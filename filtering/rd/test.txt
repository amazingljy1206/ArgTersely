i wait tables at a mall and the fire alarm goes off constantly.	car alarms i would almost go along with you, the others not so much.	the first with the fire alarm was when there was an electric short in some of our friend is basement which lit a fire.	i dont agree.	do you have any specific examples which we can talk about ? in general, i suspect that you are overestimating the value of punishment and underestimating the value of education.

all my childhood, i have been bombarded with unrealistic expectations of being quiet, demure, and smart.	i am not sure how the  model minority  stereotypes are harmful.	media had created the image of the asian woman as passive, submissive, and flat; in addition, the lack of asian female representation perpetuated this stereotype due to ignorance.	i dont think so.	do you have any specific examples which we can talk about ? in general, i suspect that you are overestimating the value of punishment and underestimating the value of education.

learning another language promotes traveling to the country where that language is spoken and learning about that culture.	learning a language is not the equivalent of learning about the culture or becoming  diverse.	pretty sure op wo not reply because they have ignored so many comments on their cmv posts but  to solve this false sense of superiority and promote true diversity the u.	i dont agree.	money is not zero sum indeed almost nothing in economics is.

so my question to you is if there truly is a catastrophic future or something truly horrifically wrong with enhancing or augmenting human beings to reach the peak of their abilities ?	but, once we  really  start tampering with the genome and dna, the risk is there that we create a new species of human.	we run the risk of creating a separate, superior species of human.	i dont agree.	wealth concentration in a society is problematic in itself because it ties up resources with a small part of the society.

to reach the peak of their abilities ?	my last question would be are these really  their  abilities if they were not there to begin with ? if they were added artificially and normally would have never developed ? it is one thing to train someone to be a faster runner or better at playing the piano, it is another to give them various abilities that they would have never ever had otherwise so there was no room for improvement at all.	sure, there are some things where we all agree i am guessing , such as eradicating certain diseases or defects, but once that is done we go into uncharted and dangerous territory.	you are wrong.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
i acknowledge there are some problems with such conflicts of interest but do these really outweigh the cost of tax hikes and/or cuts to police services ?	the other problem is that because the homicide department is relying on that money, the officers tasked with enforcing the petty crimes will not give lenience even when it is called for.	in theory this is wonderful except that the same people who profit from the money decide what actions will be criminal.	i dont agree.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
i acknowledge there are some problems with such conflicts of interest but do these really outweigh the cost of tax hikes and/or cuts to police services ?	further still, they will have incentive to fabricate crimes where none existed.	for example, there are many areas of many roadways where traffic engineers say that speed limits are too low.	you are wrong.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.

i acknowledge there are some problems with such conflicts of interest but do these really outweigh the cost of tax hikes and/or cuts to police services ?	the problem with expecting the perpetrator of a crime to pay society back for that crime is that eventually everyone has to be a criminal.	again, in theory this sounds wonderful.	i dont think so.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
i acknowledge there are some problems with such conflicts of interest but do these really outweigh the cost of tax hikes and/or cuts to police services ?	for this to look reasonable, you have to assume one of two things; that there will always be enough petty crime to completely fund the rest of the department, or that the definition of petty crime will get wider.	what do i mean ? well we only have to look at civil asset forfeiture to see where this slippery slope leads.	you are wrong.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
i acknowledge there are some problems with such conflicts of interest but do these really outweigh the cost of tax hikes and/or cuts to police services ?	this is why everyone is a criminal when police departments rely on the funds they  earn  from perpetrators.	there are jurisdictions who receive $ from the general tax base.	you are wrong.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
i acknowledge there are some problems with such conflicts of interest but do these really outweigh the cost of tax hikes and/or cuts to police services ?	they are either getting money from everyone for a crime which probably is not much of a crime given that everyone is doing it or failing that, they will make up new rules so more people can be considered guilty.	their entire operation depends on asset forfeiture.	you are wrong.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
by hoarding wealth, executives are compromising their workers  quality of life in order to enjoy an absurd amount of luxury.	one person earning $ more is $ of new income created not the reduction in pay of someone elsewhere, this is how this URL works, there is not a transfer of income from elsewhere but rather new income created.	money is not zero sum indeed almost nothing in economics is.	i dont think so.	the first thing to note is that evolution is entirely consistent with christianity, as long as you take the creation story as being allegorical.
by hoarding wealth, executives are compromising their workers  quality of life in order to enjoy an absurd amount of luxury.	on the  hoarding  its actually impossible to hoard money unless you hide it under your mattress.	in addition executive pay is notable for being primarily in the form of restricted stock awards for larger organizations particularly, often upwards of  of pay is in this form.	i dont agree.	the first thing to note is that evolution is entirely consistent with christianity, as long as you take the creation story as being allegorical.
by hoarding wealth, executives are compromising their workers  quality of life in order to enjoy an absurd amount of luxury.	their excess income ends up as capital which will end up in credit markets reducing the cost of consumer credit, why do you think mortgages, credit cards and all other loans are cheaper in the us then elsewhere ? pay itself is the equilibrium between supply   demand for skills, the skills a ceo requires are much more relatively scarce then the skills a low skilled worker needs which is why the pay differential exists.	when a company issues stock its a cost to the other shareholders, via dilution, rather then a cost to the company itself.	you are wrong.	the first thing to note is that evolution is entirely consistent with christianity, as long as you take the creation story as being allegorical.
there are many people who expect women and men, but not as often to enter into a monogamous, committed relationship before engaging in sexual activity.	that isnt what demisexuality is though, a demisexual could meet someone, talk to them, feel a deep connection, and now they are attracted to the person and can fuck them.	this is the problem that i, and i think many have with demis; a lot of them are lying or have a disstored view of what being  normal  is.	i dont think so.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
there are many people who expect women and men, but not as often to enter into a monogamous, committed relationship before engaging in sexual activity.	it seems almost the same as pan, where people claim that gender does not matter, only a persons mind can be attractive.	they seem to think that most people are dating compleatly based on attraction.	i dont think so.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
there are many people who expect women and men, but not as often to enter into a monogamous, committed relationship before engaging in sexual activity.	the only diffrence between the two seems to be that demis are less likly to be into anyone, they are straight demi or homo demi.	they ignore that most people can become attracted or less attracted to someone based on personality as well.	you are wrong.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
there are many people who expect women and men, but not as often to enter into a monogamous, committed relationship before engaging in sexual activity.	many people just want to be special, and while i would say that there is no harm in them calling themselves whatever sexuality they want, i feel it is hard to respect.	or they are flat out lying, such as when they check out or make comments about someones picture, tecically they should feel nothing when looking at a picture of a hot person, but i rarely find that to happen.	i dont think so.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
the purpose of attending college is to receive an education.	the athletes might not get as education  as good  as everyone else, but colleges do not purport to give everyone the same education.	but the athletes  do  receive an education.	i dont agree.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
the purpose of attending college is to receive an education.	to admit students under different admissions requirements because without them those athletes would not be able to attend said college is wrong, as it demonstrates that the college is not seeking to have these students represent them as an academic institution as they should be, rather as an athletic enterprise.	i am not sure how lowering requirements for athletes detracts from that purpose.	i dont think so.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
the purpose of attending college is to receive an education.	what is your basis for this ? why do you believe that every student should represent the student as an academic institution ? what is your reasoning for this assertion ? it seems like this is the fundamental backing behind your argument.	so i am not sure what your point here.	you are wrong.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.
the purpose of attending college is to receive an education.	but , i see no reason why we ca not create new institutions that operate almost exactly like the dictionary definition of colleges, except that the academic requirements for the top athletes are lowered.	you believe that a college that places emphasis of athletics over academics for some students somehow invalidates the institution as a college, by definition.	you are wrong.	the evidence shows that the earth is very, very old.

the idea that wealthy people have a negative effect of society, is a grossly overused stereotype and is detrimental to the development of a functional society.	what is unfair about it ? that we know you have had a far easier life than the vast majority of the population ? that a solid majority of them are politically active to further suppress any progress the  arest of us  might attain, and simultaneously increase their money piles ? that it is starting to look more and more like the system is rigged ? only now, it is become much, much more apparent of just how fucked the system is.	fuck that, and fuck them.	i dont agree.	here is the thing: laptops are portable computers.

god is all loving in his own, unknowable way.	if we ca not possibly understand god, then we have no basis for thinking that god has reason to act one way over another way.	there is nothing about christianity that says you have to believe in young earth creationism, intelligent design, or any other  guided  form of creation.	i dont agree.	what are the benefits of having to pay for college besides giving money back to the people who you received an education from ? there is no such a thing as a free lunch.
god is all loving in his own, unknowable way.	we have no reason to make any assumptions about what god would or would not do, nor about why.	given this lack of any reason to presuppose that god is likely to think or act in any given way, all we have left is the evidence around us.	you are wrong.	what are the benefits of having to pay for college besides giving money back to the people who you received an education from ? there is no such a thing as a free lunch.
god is all loving in his own, unknowable way.	making the assumption that god would create a young universe or an old universe, or a purple universe, or anything at all really is ascribing traits to god that we ca not possibly have any basis for thinking are actually true.	we know that looking at stuff can give us worthwhile knowledge about it.	you are wrong.	what are the benefits of having to pay for college besides giving money back to the people who you received an education from ? there is no such a thing as a free lunch.

god is all loving in his own, unknowable way.	they are completely baseless assumptions.	when we look at the universe, the evidence that we find suggests that the universe is around  billion years old, and that earth is around  billion years old.	i dont think so.	what are the benefits of having to pay for college besides giving money back to the people who you received an education from ? there is no such a thing as a free lunch.

i try to follow some comedians, but their tweets are usually something like  i am in chicago tonight, come my show.	then do not follow them; follow someone who uses twitter in a way you find more engaging.	twitter the website is nigh unusable, but twitter the service is pretty usable.	you are wrong.	most of this treatment is for religion  or  sincerely held beliefs.
too many weird  symbols and hashtags and URL just creates a fatiguing reading experience.	could not the replies be grouped with the original tweet without having to click on the name and then click  wouldetails ?   yes, they could ! in tweetdeck and tweetbot and a lot of other twitter clients, it is one click or on mobile clients, gesture to bring up that view.	twitter the website is nigh unusable, but twitter the service is pretty usable.	i dont think so.	there is basically a verse riff/beat and a chorus riff/beat, and these two repeat.

people will often need a break: bathroom, food, drink, simply to stretch.	with the size of snacks offered, most people would be too full to stock up again during the intermission.	it will be nice to pee, grab a soda without missing part of the movie.	i dont think so.	you yourself admit to becoming outraged when people litter, which is really just a form of vandalism.
people will often need a break: bathroom, food, drink, simply to stretch.	this leaves us with the need to stretch, and our culture is fairly accustomed to long stretches of being sedentary so it is a very minor point.	most people solve this by going to the bathroom and purchasing snacks on arriving at the theater.	i dont think so.	you yourself admit to becoming outraged when people litter, which is really just a form of vandalism.
sure, maybe one movie out of a thousand ca not be interrupted without ruining artistic vision.	however most movies will easily tolerate a   minutes break.	it sounds like you believe there is a need for intermissions simply because people do not adequately prepare themselves for sitting for two hours.	i dont agree.	you yourself admit to becoming outraged when people litter, which is really just a form of vandalism.
sure, maybe one movie out of a thousand ca not be interrupted without ruining artistic vision.	directors cam even use it to their advantage: for example by creating mini climaxes, or small cliffhangers before the intermission.	potty break before the movie starts, grab popcorn/candy, and probably most importantly, do not drink a gallon of soda in half an hour.	i dont agree.	you yourself admit to becoming outraged when people litter, which is really just a form of vandalism.
sure, maybe one movie out of a thousand ca not be interrupted without ruining artistic vision.	i would argue that the ratio is the other way around.	advertisers pay theaters to run ads at the movie is start time because there is a captive audience with nothing to do but sit there and watch whatever is on the screen.	i dont agree.	you yourself admit to becoming outraged when people litter, which is really just a form of vandalism.
sure, maybe one movie out of a thousand ca not be interrupted without ruining artistic vision.	for every one movie where an intermission half way would make sense and the movie was created in a way to allow for an intermission without detracting from the experience, there is a thousand where the movies were not created with the intent of the audience walking away for fifteen minutes.	if intermissions worked the way you want them to, everyone is going to be peeing, getting food, walking around, etc.	i dont agree.	you yourself admit to becoming outraged when people litter, which is really just a form of vandalism.
sure, maybe one movie out of a thousand ca not be interrupted without ruining artistic vision.	movie theaters did away with breaks to squeeze in more screen time, so intermissions will cut into already slim profit.	no advertiser is going to spend the same amount of money on ads if three quarters of the audience is in the bathroom.	you are wrong.	you yourself admit to becoming outraged when people litter, which is really just a form of vandalism.
sure, maybe one movie out of a thousand ca not be interrupted without ruining artistic vision.	my response: movie theaters already show commercials pre movies, why not just shift some ads from pre movie time to the intermission time ? no money is lost.	basically, most movies are not long enough to bring on a state of uncomfortableness to begin with, and the need for an intermission in a shorter movie is almost completely avoided by coming into the theater prepared to sit for two hours.	you are wrong.	you yourself admit to becoming outraged when people litter, which is really just a form of vandalism.
why not just shift some ads from pre movie time to the intermission time ?	i generally agree with you in theory, but getting letting a hundred people out and then getting them back in would be a huge pain.	most theaters assign specific seats which makes getting back in simpler.	i dont agree.	i get even more annoyed by people who are ready to call for someone to be sent to prison for toppling over an old rock or for pouring tar on an old rock.
why not just shift some ads from pre movie time to the intermission time ?	in theater it does not matter how long the first act is, but if you are trying to stagger intermission times and movies have the intermission at different times within the movie, that makes scheduling  much  more complicated.	at your average movie, you  know  there would be some jerks who would try to take your seat during intermission.	i dont agree.	i get even more annoyed by people who are ready to call for someone to be sent to prison for toppling over an old rock or for pouring tar on an old rock.
why not just shift some ads from pre movie time to the intermission time ?	that would totally kill the mood of the movie and make it a much less enjoyable experience.	you also realistically could not do an intermission shorter than  minutes if you wanted people to have a chance to go to the bathroom or get food or drink.	you are wrong.	i get even more annoyed by people who are ready to call for someone to be sent to prison for toppling over an old rock or for pouring tar on an old rock.

institutions are acting on the premise that religiously motivated predilections deserve more respect, concern, deference, and action than those derived from other reasons.	but if the man just  wouldoes not like it  then it is no more grounds for accommodation than me not enjoying the in flight movie.	we allow this because we understand that disabled people have different needs to accommodate.	i dont agree.	sure it can.
institutions are acting on the premise that religiously motivated predilections deserve more respect, concern, deference, and action than those derived from other reasons.	i am taking it good faith that you are not trying to argue the specifics of religious or the validity of their beliefs.	the question is: do religious beliefs change a person is needs enough to allow accommodations ? i think they do.	i dont think so.	sure it can.
tax treatment, in flight meals, seating preferences, alternate testing dates, and special consideration of any kind that is offered in exchange for verification of religious observance is unfair to people without religion.	most of this treatment is for religion  or  sincerely held beliefs.	examples ?.	i dont agree.	on the government the plutocrats maybe, but no, it is the greedy capitalists.

the recordings also sound like low quality recordings done by setting a tape recorder down in front of the band while in the garage.	i do not think this makes the music bad; it makes the genre a bit strict, and for those who enjoy it, it allows a certain familiarity with the music that likely lends to the tightly knit community.	there is basically a verse riff/beat and a chorus riff/beat, and these two repeat.	i dont agree.	i think you are misunderstanding what mcluhan was saying.
the recordings also sound like low quality recordings done by setting a tape recorder down in front of the band while in the garage.	if you had the ramones step into a modern big time record label is studio and record an album, the sound quality, engineering, and production value would make them sound extremely polished and professional.	i will grant that punk music tends to stay in a relatively narrow range of chords and beats, but it is hard to vary much outside of this range without straying from the genre itself.	i dont agree.	i think you are misunderstanding what mcluhan was saying.

the recordings also sound like low quality recordings done by setting a tape recorder down in front of the band while in the garage.	it is about the music, and real music is flawed.	but i think the role of a punk singer is less about actual  singing  in the traditional sense, and more about evoking the song is mood.	i dont think so.	i think you are misunderstanding what mcluhan was saying.
the recordings also sound like low quality recordings done by setting a tape recorder down in front of the band while in the garage.	if you asked any big time band to go into your garage and play some music, they would sound just like any other garage band and that is great ! punk music is like seeing a decent local band: you are there with them, the levels turned way up, hearing them play raw, without the pretension and facade of a  million dollar sound system.	punk could be about letting out frustration, or getting riled up with energy, or to simply marvel at the band is own expression of this energy.	i dont think so.	i think you are misunderstanding what mcluhan was saying.
the recordings also sound like low quality recordings done by setting a tape recorder down in front of the band while in the garage.	i think it is a bit hyperbolic to call these bands  like a bad high school rock band,  but the recording quality is not far off.	the vocalist is pitch is less important than his timbre and expression.	you are wrong.	i think you are misunderstanding what mcluhan was saying.
the recordings also sound like low quality recordings done by setting a tape recorder down in front of the band while in the garage.	that is part of the charm.	even if you replaced a punk vocalist with a very talented, professional singer, there would not be too much of a difference due to the nature of the vocals assuming the singer is trying to emulate/complement the punk style.	you are wrong.	i think you are misunderstanding what mcluhan was saying.

the earth cannot be controlled like a science experiment.	sure it can.	just because our scientific understanding changes, does not mean science is inherently flawed.	i dont think so.	i believe we should find the root of the anger/depression/etc causing them to commit crimes instead of simply throwing them behind bars.

why ca not we do something like that again, continuously, increasingly ?	why not just pay people to be unemployed instead of finding busywork ? there is also the notion that this type of thing results in the government competing against private businesses.	if you complain or gloat to your boss,  i am finished with everything, this is boring, there is nothing to do !  , he will gladly find something for you to do though it probably wo not be fun.	i dont think so.	that is just awkward and it just would not happen.

one reason is that the current  health insurance  system run by the government va, medicare, medicaid appears to be poorly run.	if everyone was on medicare, i think there would be a lot more political weight behind making it better.	there is free public healthcare available for everyone but additionally and confusingly you can also choose to go through the private healthcare system via insurance/out of pocket.	you are wrong.	that is just awkward and it just would not happen.
one reason is that the current  health insurance  system run by the government va, medicare, medicaid appears to be poorly run.	if the us ca not cope with insurance and health care for this very small portion of the population, how can they be expected to competently handle the entire population ? in my experience, happens in both systems in australia.	i doubt the same stuff does not also happen to privately insured people in the usa.	you are wrong.	that is just awkward and it just would not happen.
one reason is that the current  health insurance  system run by the government va, medicare, medicaid appears to be poorly run.	i do not think it is a systematic problem as much as it is a problem any large organisation or system has.	my impression is that there are fewer and fewer people becoming doctors because the cost of becoming one is going up via school bills and increasing malpractice insurance requirements for doctors while compensation is going down especially for doctors who accept medicare/medicaid/hmos american doctors make far, far more than doctors in other systems.	i dont agree.	that is just awkward and it just would not happen.

secondly, there is the issue of finances.	physician salary can be improved by letting the government dictate their compensation for procedures rather than negotiation, by requiring them to be paid a certain yearly salary rather than fee for service, or by making their negotiating position more fair.	my impression is that there are fewer and fewer people becoming doctors because the cost of becoming one is going up via school bills and increasing malpractice insurance requirements for doctors while compensation is going down especially for doctors who accept medicare/medicaid/hmos.	i dont agree.	because it is my body and not the government is the laws against these drugs are not for your bodily protection.
secondly, there is the issue of finances.	right now, insurance companies are generally legally immune to patient lawsuits for failure to cover needed care.	if we switch to a universal system, i would expect compensation to decrease since more names on the rolls more bargaining power for insurance companies and that a shortage in doctors is inevitable.	i dont agree.	because it is my body and not the government is the laws against these drugs are not for your bodily protection.
secondly, there is the issue of finances.	take away that immunity, and their ability to negotiate with physicians would be much less one sided.	this, in my understanding, would result in more difficulty in seeing a doctor and less competent treatment due to a heavy case load.	i dont think so.	because it is my body and not the government is the laws against these drugs are not for your bodily protection.

thus, the only thing we can do is take supposedly  scientific  theories by faith since there is no evidence and no way to prove or disprove them.	this is not a reason to stop looking, most of the explanations are thought experiements, and given enough time most will be modified or rejected by new evidence.	we do not know where the universe came from, and any scientist worth their salt will happily admit this.	you are wrong.	i think there are many pressing domestic issues.
my view is that we should admit we do not know where the universe came from, and stop speculating.	we most definitely should not stop speculating, because there might be testable theory that explains origin of universe and if we do are not trying to found it out, we will probably not found it out.	no serious physicist will claim that he knows what was before big bang.	you are wrong.	i do not think it is unreasonable to do background checks on adoptive couples.
my view is that we should admit we do not know where the universe came from, and stop speculating.	this is evergoing theme in history of science, origin of species, origin of stars, explanations of comets, breaking enigma code and many more.	they all realize that all we have are speculations.	you are wrong.	i do not think it is unreasonable to do background checks on adoptive couples.

we do not know what came before the big bang.	how sure are you that this is a valid question to ask ? actually, the observable evidence for the big bang is incredibly substantial.	we understand evolution far better than how we understand gravity.	i dont think so.	i do not think you have a grasp on how bad things can get.
we do not know what came before the big bang.	while we do not have all of the details, we pretty much know for a fact that it happened.	now, in order to determine whether or not i am wasting my time with you, i would like for you to describe how the multiverse explanation came into existence, and why many scientists, mostly theoretical physicists, like it.	i dont agree.	i do not think you have a grasp on how bad things can get.
we do not know what came before the big bang.	uh, yeah we do URL again, it is supported by massive amounts of evidence.	personally, i am not the biggest fan of multiverse theory, to say the least, but i am not going to pretend for a second that it is some blind stab in the dark like intelligent design.	you are wrong.	i do not think you have a grasp on how bad things can get.

the easiest one to understand is intelligent design: the idea that a supreme being created the universe.	suggesting that the universe is the product of an intelligent designer who cannot be fully comprehended by any human mind is functionally equivalent to giving up on the project of explanation altogether.	i would argue that intelligent design is not a way of  understanding  anything.	i dont agree.	this leads to a concentration of currency in the remaining population of actors.

the easiest one to understand is intelligent design: the idea that a supreme being created the universe.	the question is, are we interested in at least  trying  to understand the origins of existence ? if we are, then id is not a position we can endorse, because it basically means accepting our ignorance as an inevitable consequence of god is fundamentally incomprehensible nature.	i do not think that is necessarily the reason why people dislike it.	i dont agree.	this leads to a concentration of currency in the remaining population of actors.

my view is that we should admit we do not know where the universe came from, and stop speculating.	i think most naturalists would agree that we do not know where the universe came from, but that is no reason to stop speculating.	i would argue that intelligent design is not a way of  understanding  anything.	you are wrong.	well many species live in nests or take refuge in elaborate burrows and dens, especially rodents.

if these were implemented, i feel like there would be a huge decline in children with childhood trauma or broken households.	do you forcibly sterilize them so they cannot reproduce ? i do not know about you, but i would rather drown than live in a country where the state owns our bodies and can force us into surgeries that we do not want, or one in which we have to ask the government is permission to reproduce.	it is important to make sure nobody is seeking to adopt a child for criminal purposes.	you are wrong.	people studying and majoring in these fields  is  how they are  fostered and supported.
if these were implemented, i feel like there would be a huge decline in children with childhood trauma or broken households.	there is no way to enforce such a test without stripping us all of our right to bodily autonomy and to literally violate the bodies of a large portion of citizens.	it would be great if we could make it possible for nobody who would be a shit parent to have a child too.	i dont agree.	people studying and majoring in these fields  is  how they are  fostered and supported.

within the games themselves, the way certain groups of tributes gleefully ally with one another and hunt down others seems unbelievable.	a few kids every so often is nothing compared to the evils we have done to each other in reality.	i do not think you have a grasp on how bad things can get.	i dont agree.	i will preface this by saying that i do prefer my steaks medium rare, and would never get them another way.
within the games themselves, the way certain groups of tributes gleefully ally with one another and hunt down others seems unbelievable.	there is just a cognitive dissonance between their own sense of humanity and desire to live, and their joyous reception of the participants in the games, immediately followed by their cheering on their murdering one another.	when columbus was governor of the indies the native population was treated so poorly that mothers were killing their own children right after birth out of mercy so that their children would not have to suffer such horrors.	i dont think so.	i will preface this by saying that i do prefer my steaks medium rare, and would never get them another way.

we are all perpetrators if we do not actively fight against the acts of our government.	i believe we are all accomplices of our government is actions because we suppor that very same government with our taxes.	right, because it was obama the one that started the whole iraq and afghanistan clusterfucks, no way bush had anything to do with those.	i dont agree.	that is not why he joins the front.

due to a number of factors, economic actors on the bottom end of the economy the poor eventually drop off the economic map and become non actors.	correlation does not equal causation, but if it were true that free economies increase economic inequality, then you would expect to see a correlative trend that indicates this.	however, if you look at the overall picture, you will see a clear trend; the more free a society is economy i.	i dont think so.	that is just his relationship to the existence of snipers.

i also dislike the notion of inebriety being seen as something desirable and cool.	by avoiding anything to do with what you call  drinking culture  you are effectively avoiding anything to do with western culture as a whole.	this is only part of highschool   college.	i dont agree.	, then anybody who disagrees is part of the problem and must be removed from the path of progress.

there is a huge difference between saying:  you should not carry a gun.	carry a taser instead,  versus saying  you should not carry a gun, just piss yourself when attacked there are a lot of people who genuinely believe  you should not defend yourself except by fleeing and calling the police.	i think you are giving this position a little less credit than it deserves.	you are wrong.	the first thing that comes to my mind is fire departments.
i hear the argument many times that having a gun in the home for defense will cause far more harm than good.	you did not mention any arguments that show positive results of gun ownership i assure you they exist.	i will not comment on the validity of that argument.	you are wrong.	when you differentiate between those who actively support a movement and those who criticize it, is the method of support important ? as you have noted in other posts, civil disobedience is one facet of a complex political system which includes legislators the civil rights movement needed people like johnson as well as king.
i hear the argument many times that having a gun in the home for defense will cause far more harm than good.	perhaps you need to hear some outside voices on an issue that is very divisive and has intelligent people on both sides.	i have heard that concealed carry will escalate violence.	you are wrong.	when you differentiate between those who actively support a movement and those who criticize it, is the method of support important ? as you have noted in other posts, civil disobedience is one facet of a complex political system which includes legislators the civil rights movement needed people like johnson as well as king.

or if i would go and scream into a lion is ears, and he would then murder me.	like many animals, lions do not have the same morality sense that humans do.	not funny does not mean anything.	you are wrong.	if the movement cannot respond amicably to criticism, one has to wonder what else is being packaged in with the ideals that are claimed.
or if i would go and scream into a lion is ears, and he would then murder me.	the lion would attack you but because you will be deemed an immediate threat.	yes they do.	i dont think so.	if the movement cannot respond amicably to criticism, one has to wonder what else is being packaged in with the ideals that are claimed.
or if i would go and scream into a lion is ears, and he would then murder me.	their behavior was very animal like, i wo not deny that.	but the entirety of media does this.	i dont think so.	if the movement cannot respond amicably to criticism, one has to wonder what else is being packaged in with the ideals that are claimed.
or if i would go and scream into a lion is ears, and he would then murder me.	but does that necessarily mean any satire about mohammed needs to be censored ? if you say that the people at ch deserved what they got even  kinda  deserved what they got then you are saying that the terrorists  behavior was justified.	all the time.	you are wrong.	if the movement cannot respond amicably to criticism, one has to wonder what else is being packaged in with the ideals that are claimed.
or if i would go and scream into a lion is ears, and he would then murder me.	if you say that it is ok to kill people for speech one deems offensive then there would be no speech.	whenever you see two people debate on any major news network regarding a controversy, there is insulting.	you are wrong.	if the movement cannot respond amicably to criticism, one has to wonder what else is being packaged in with the ideals that are claimed.
or if i would go and scream into a lion is ears, and he would then murder me.	under your view, if i were to find your overall view to be offensive then your view would mean i would be justified in killing you.	there is immaturity.	i dont agree.	if the movement cannot respond amicably to criticism, one has to wonder what else is being packaged in with the ideals that are claimed.
or if i would go and scream into a lion is ears, and he would then murder me.	but in real life, it wo not be.	purposefully people on the internet do that too.	you are wrong.	if the movement cannot respond amicably to criticism, one has to wonder what else is being packaged in with the ideals that are claimed.
also, i have heard story after story of unmarried couples living together.  then a breakup happens.  then months of awkwardness ensue.	all you can do is try to make a relationship work.	that sounds very romantic, but your views simply are not realistic.	you are wrong.	the problem with this mindset is that you enter into an encounter with someone new  expecting  them to do something for you, thereby  earning  your respect for them.
we ca not enforce a number of vacation days but taking fridays off is kind of a cultural thing that is harder to avoid.	why ca not we enforce vacation days ? the us has no minimum number of days off, but:   germany mandates  days off   spain mandates  days off, plus  public holidays   even afghanistan afghanistan ! has  days off and  public holidays basically, the rest of the civilized world has mandatory minimum days off.	i agree that we should have more time off, but i also agree with this:   now some would say we should just get more vacation days.	you are wrong.	some of them went to the military and killed some brown/asian people.
we ca not enforce a number of vacation days but taking fridays off is kind of a cultural thing that is harder to avoid.	it is not  days, but it is a minimum, and there is a cultural aspect to it as well maybe you would not feel it as much going from spain to the uk, where it is  days off including some weird holidays , but if you had to move to the us for work, that would be a huge shift.	and i have a lot of vacation days now, and it works pretty well.	you are wrong.	some of them went to the military and killed some brown/asian people.
and anyway, to some extent i think taking fridays off is sort of already happening anyway.	i work for a large company that is often deserted by   pm on friday.	i agree that we should have more time off, but i also agree with this:   now some would say we should just get more vacation days.	i dont agree.	some of them went to the military and killed some brown/asian people.
and anyway, to some extent i think taking fridays off is sort of already happening anyway.	thing is, that also happens when friday is a holiday people leave early on thursday.	and i have a lot of vacation days now, and it works pretty well.	you are wrong.	some of them went to the military and killed some brown/asian people.
and i think there is a case to be made that we do not need to invoke power over intrastate commerce to uphold civil rights protections.	and last, i think you must be from the southern usa, because to say this implies you do not really understand how the civil rights struggle worked.	so here is the deal, when the commerce clause was written, they were referring to basically a reality where the states were essentially independent of each other, and federalism was controversial.	i dont agree.	many are homophobic and sexist.
and i think there is a case to be made that we do not need to invoke power over intrastate commerce to uphold civil rights protections.	and segregation is basically a form of economic boycott against a specific group.	clearly, th century pennsylvania and virginia for example did not have the relationship that they did by the s.	i dont agree.	many are homophobic and sexist.
and i think there is a case to be made that we do not need to invoke power over intrastate commerce to uphold civil rights protections.	and the federal government, as you know because you are probably a l , wanted to address this problem but they do not have a general police power, so they could not just make it illegal on the basis of it being wrong, so they had to make it illegal to boycott people on the basis of race because it effects the economy.	you needed to take a horse for days to get from one to the other.	i dont think so.	many are homophobic and sexist.
and i think there is a case to be made that we do not need to invoke power over intrastate commerce to uphold civil rights protections.	they had no other means to do so.	so, th century virginia could legitimately be self sufficient, and could have economic activity that did not substantially effect other states because there was not a basis for demand from the other states.	i dont think so.	many are homophobic and sexist.
and i think there is a case to be made that we do not need to invoke power over intrastate commerce to uphold civil rights protections.	and that is why they used the commerce clause.	if you made too much wheat in , it would just rot.	you are wrong.	many are homophobic and sexist.
i think that there should be a limit to what you can say.	well, in the us there is a limit on what you can say.	he was asked if basketball is boring to him because he is around it all of the time.	i dont agree.	that is why animals will be killed and eaten even after we are perfectly capable of growing meat in a lab.
i think that there should be a limit to what you can say.	you ca not yell  bomb  on a plane or  fire  in a crowded theater.	his response was essentially  gynecologists are around vaginas all the time and they do not get bored, so why should i ?   some people got offended.	i dont agree.	that is why animals will be killed and eaten even after we are perfectly capable of growing meat in a lab.
i think that there should be a limit to what you can say.	you also cannot threatens someone.	others did not.	you are wrong.	that is why animals will be killed and eaten even after we are perfectly capable of growing meat in a lab.
i think that there should be a limit to what you can say.	this just is not reasonable.	how do you solve this particular situation ? tell the people who got offended that they ca not be offended ? do we make what he said illegal ? i just do not see how there is an actual solution to this.	i dont agree.	that is why animals will be killed and eaten even after we are perfectly capable of growing meat in a lab.
i think that there should be a limit to what you can say.	so speech is either  acceptable or  illegal and there is no middle ground ? just yesterday, the general manager of the houston rockets basketball compared his job to that of a gynecologist.	you are asking people to never be offended unless the speech is actually illegal.	i dont agree.	that is why animals will be killed and eaten even after we are perfectly capable of growing meat in a lab.
as in nobody could even think about asking the cancellation of a show for a presenter remark, universities should not have speech codes, firms could not legally fire anybody for their views, no matter how extreme.	persons this includes both people and companies have a few rights: .	are you going to legally limit someone else is right to free speech so that people do not get criticized for the things they say ? .	i dont think so.	in the old testament, elijah performs what is essentially a controlled experiment for the existence of god when he calls upon the fire at mt.
then, once such limits are set, that cover only the true extremes, i think that everything else should be consequence free.	if i call you an asshole, does this mean that you are not allowed to shun me ? not invite me to parties ? because not inviting me to parties is  definitely  a consequence of my calling you an asshole.	i am not even sure what this would mean.	you are wrong.	it is a sign of respect.
nintendo botched the launch of the wii u by not providing titles people wanted.	so yes, nintendo is bad in this regard but that is because they are insular and not for the reason you gave.	nintendo specifically delayed its titles in order for third parties to not get drowned out by their releases, as they are on every other nintendo console.	i dont think so.	béchamel eggs are not haute cuisine, but are very very french.
nintendo botched the launch of the wii u by not providing titles people wanted.	it simply does not make sense to put all the resources into building their own console.	third parties let them down except maybe ubisoft   nintendo does not seem to care about third party developers and as a result you pay the cost of a full console to play a few games.	i dont agree.	béchamel eggs are not haute cuisine, but are very very french.
nintendo botched the launch of the wii u by not providing titles people wanted.	for nintendo as a business and you as consumer, this would be the worst possible thing.	nintendo does not have a good relation with many western third party developers in general.	i dont agree.	béchamel eggs are not haute cuisine, but are very very french.
the wii u should be their last console.	they realize that it is a harder task on a nintendo system, so they do not make games for them in the first place.	nintendo specifically delayed its titles in order for third parties to not get drowned out by their releases, as they are on every other nintendo console.	i dont think so.	my parents are lucky as shit i grew up gay or else i may have been a  year old father ! why would you have been a father ? did she have somebody else is child right around that time ? honestly i feel like you are not as educated on this topic as you think you are.
the wii u should be their last console.	in short, this is a much more complicated issue than you are making it out to be and while nintendo is part of the problem, it is not the problem itself.	third parties let them down except maybe ubisoft   nintendo does not seem to care about third party developers and as a result you pay the cost of a full console to play a few games.	i dont think so.	my parents are lucky as shit i grew up gay or else i may have been a  year old father ! why would you have been a father ? did she have somebody else is child right around that time ? honestly i feel like you are not as educated on this topic as you think you are.

a lot of times people point out very crazy things that the bible says as to why the bible is bad.	however a lot of people fail to point out that the bible is very old and has been translated a million times.	it come out something different.	i dont think so.	influenza vaccination of health care workers in long term care hospitals reduces the mortality of elderly patients.
a lot of times people point out very crazy things that the bible says as to why the bible is bad.	the bible is supposed to be the true word of god.	do the minor translation differences remove genocide, slavery, hatred for sexual orientations, etc ? this is not google translate, this is many people working together to get it right.	i dont think so.	influenza vaccination of health care workers in long term care hospitals reduces the mortality of elderly patients.

however a lot of people fail to point out that the bible is very old and has been translated a million times.	most credible bible translators do not work from preceding translations, but work from transcriptions of the oldest extant copies of the passages in question, directly from the source language to the target language.	ever translated something a million times using google translate.	i dont think so.	unless you are saving money by burying it in your yard, savers and investors are the same thing.

however a lot of people fail to point out that the bible is very old and has been translated a million times.	there are things modern people might not understand due to not having a cultural understanding of pre nd century jewish/roman culture, but the translations are reliable, not subjected to the iterations of twisting you cite.	not true.	you are wrong.	unless you are saving money by burying it in your yard, savers and investors are the same thing.
talent is the ability to learn something to a certain degree faster than an average person.	i meant that they will become good at it, not necessarily on a competitive level, but good enough to be considered more than just mediocre.	of course the degree varies from person to person.	i dont think so.	unless you are saving money by burying it in your yard, savers and investors are the same thing.
talent is the ability to learn something to a certain degree faster than an average person.	essentially, that means knowing how to learn hint ! hint ! usually the answer is lots of practice, or being practiced at a skill that involves related motions or thought patterns  an instrument which you need to be incredibly talented to master and also you have to start from a very young age i would not agree with any part of that statement.	in my experience; talent, as you put it, is the result of knowing how to learn something effectively.	you are wrong.	how does the us pay for the increased interest ? it takes on more debt through the federal reserve.
if i ran the government, i would expand the postal service to get into the shipping business.	the postal service receives no tax dollars for operating expenses, and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations.	wrong.	i dont agree.	food imports are generally for crops that are generally too expensive, too unreliable or incapable of being grown here like sugarcane or pineapples.

if i ran the government, i would expand the postal service to get into the shipping business.	the financial problem it faces now comes from a  congressional mandate that requires the agency to  pre pay  into a fund that covers health care costs for future retired employees.	these  prepayments  are largely responsible for the usps is financial losses over the past four years and the threat of shutdown that looms ahead   take the retirement fund out of the equation, and the postal service would have actually netted $ billion in profits over this period.	i dont agree.	food imports are generally for crops that are generally too expensive, too unreliable or incapable of being grown here like sugarcane or pineapples.

throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	first off, yes, horses were domesticated earlier, but they were not ridden in to battle until relatively recently in military history, granted, this being several thousand years ago.	uhhhh, i do not think you have your factoids particularly clear.	i dont agree.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	even then, the primary tool of war was the infantryman.	chariots were the primary form of horse usage for many cultures that employed them egypt, assyrians, hittites, britons, listing a few.	you are wrong.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	and so it has been for virtually the entirety of military history.	before swords were commonplace ? depends on the development and use of swords in the relevant cultures, but possibly.	i dont think so.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	barring a few, and a very few, exceptions, namely the huns, mongols and associable peoples that made extensive use of cavalry, but for a very specific and unique form of combat that has not been reciprocated virtually anywhere else.	man on a horse with a spear ? seriously, lances are incredibly useful for taking out a single opponent at speed.	i dont agree.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	however, you are forgetting perhaps the most prominent hand weapon that ever been used, and coincidentally, the most effective, in varying forms, against cavalry.	particularly if they have more substantial hand weapons than you do.	i dont think so.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	the spear.	smaller weapons you want when you want to strike at a foe at a shorter range, or what you want when you have stopped.	i dont think so.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	invented before horses were even domesticated and later put into use as military weapons, these things increasingly became the quintessential anti cavalry weapons dense formations of spear equipped infantry, particularly after they became more organised and equipped with longer spears, were the death of any cavalry.	and you do not, if you are on a horse, want to stop.	you are wrong.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	at that point, the infantry gets the upper hand unilaterally and instantly and can virtually wipe out a stationary cavalry force.	not to make a rule, of course but if you actually want cavalry to  fight  and not simply charge, you do not want to send it at well trained infantry, in fact, that is exactly the last thing you want to do.	you are wrong.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	bayonet deployment and square formations, effective against cavalry when used in conjunction, also decreased cavalry is effectiveness in combat for anything other than  support.	no, you need infantry to be able to defeat infantry, and use cavalry for support.	you are wrong.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	particularly at this point with bullets flying around, and cavalry being a substantial target.	seriously ? leaving aside massed musket armed infantry that were the quintessential method of fighting from the th century to the late th ? the pike was even abandoned as a common field weapon in the th century, barring a brief revival in france in the s.	you are wrong.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	giving you a list just from the top of my head of the many, many battles throughout the entirety of human history not decided by cavalry would not nearly do justice to just how incorrect that statement is.	source ? i very much doubt that statistic.	i dont agree.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	sieges were extremely important throughout history for wars, thanks to their administrative importance because you needed central administration to be able to conduct wars, organise the logistics of wars and govern the surrounding area once you would won the wars and yet cavalry are virtually superfluous for them.	particularly as the mongol empire only covered / of the world is population, it is very doubtful that they already killed a full third of it.	i dont think so.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
throughout our history battles were decided by cavalry.	yes, cavalry have been very useful throughout history but cavalry could not have truly turned the tide considering military conduct when you think about  everything else.	besides which, though, the british empire covered the largest landmass, achieved through use of the royal and merchant navies, not insignificant volumes of gunpowder, colonisation and a vast trading network.	i dont agree.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.
i respond with  is the privacy of your sacred private messages to a  ghost like  person worth possibly preventing a terrorist plot  ?	the nsa can easily hand data to other agencies.	or that data is mishandled and ends up in the hands of someone who  does  care.	you are wrong.	you seriously believe appearance is almost everything in life, even moreso than wealth or power ? i mean, no one would give a shit about the dude on the right if the dude on the left is uncle is bill gates and the dude on the right lives in a trailer park.
college is supposed to be a positive investment, two years of financial debt and no return spending books ect.	only recently has the university been sold as the gateway to the general job market.	detract from that greatly, as a risk assessment.	you are wrong.	there are opinions that are more situationally appropriate than others.
college is supposed to be a positive investment, two years of financial debt and no return spending books ect.	for most of its history, the university has been a repository for knowledge, inquiry, research, and intellectual freedom.	while there are parts of your general view that i agree with, i want to point out one thing.	you are wrong.	there are opinions that are more situationally appropriate than others.
college is supposed to be a positive investment, two years of financial debt and no return spending books ect.	the past few decades have seen the university model turn more into a business model, and the general problems we see with it today stem from this two faced nature.	as it slips more into the job prep role, the leftover pieces from the old paradigm will seem to be less and less applicable, as you have noted in your view.	you are wrong.	there are opinions that are more situationally appropriate than others.

today, the world is filled with conflicts between religious groups.	but the end goal of every war is securing resources, and establishing political power.	the various sects and divisions of religion have very little to do with religion is various underlying philosophies generally:  wouldo not be an asshole.	i dont think so.	it involves so many assumptions you would need scientific notation to count them.

our political system also allows for lobbyists to come and push their agendas to legislators.	these lobbyists also use  funding  to try and influence political representation that favors their agendas.	anyways, lobbying is not corruption.	you are wrong.	the pilot episode contained some misleading visuals, i will give you that.

there is a tremendous amount of overlap between high school curriculum and the core college curriculum in the united states.	and   by eliminating the last two years of high school, students will be spared the redundancy.	many school are combating this by offering a wide variety of college level ap and ib and duel credit classes to allow ambitious students to get ahead.	i dont think so.	this may be out of the point but i fail to see how democratic state can unite and restrict itself in time of war.

i also feel thar their culture contributes to violence.	as though  all  black people have some unified culture that is uniform across all possible neighborhoods with a black population.	let is be clear here you are talking specifically about one minority group, black people.	you are wrong.	i am not sure that i understand how that follows.
i also feel thar their culture contributes to violence.	part of what appears to make you uncomfortable is an unfair generalization of white people, right ? so why then do you make an unfair generalization of black people ? what does cooperation with the police have to do with your comfort levels ? are you going to minority neighborhoods with the specific purpose of  snitching  ? the majority of the people who listen to rap are white people, so that point is moot unless you are going to say that you also feel uncomfortable in white neighborhoods because white people sometimes listen to rap.	unless you feel equally uncomfortable in neighborhoods with a majority of asian people in them.	i dont agree.	i am not sure that i understand how that follows.
appearance is almost everything apart from living in a first world country with an adequate environment and health in life.	you seriously believe appearance is almost everything in life, even moreso than wealth or power ? i mean, no one would give a shit about the dude on the right if the dude on the left is uncle is bill gates and the dude on the right lives in a trailer park.	and plus, cosmetic surgery ai not cheap.	you are wrong.	here is another thing which although  debatable by prescriptionists  nonetheless improves the intention and inflection of the sentence to readers.

that is just about a worst case scenario for occam is razor.	it involves so many assumptions you would need scientific notation to count them.	let me see if i understand your problem.	i dont agree.	ergo,  brain sex that does not change.

in the first episode, the ship of the imagination flies through the asteroid belt, and must dodge between the asteroids, which are a few dozens of meters apart.	to which, you would probably criticize that they did not even bother to show the asteroid belt in the first place ! do you also apply this same criticism to say, physical solar system models that are not in exact : ratios ? anything involving the ship of the imagination is simply done to visually illustrate a concept.	it is not supposed to be  accurate.	i dont think so.	in many parts of the world, the age of consent is .
we later see a very cool three dimensional model of the great red spot on jupiter.	the pilot episode contained some misleading visuals, i will give you that.	i understand the general thrust of your contention: if one representation is false, how can i trust that all representations are not false ? in order for me to accept your view, however, i think you need to demonstrate this with false facts, not cool special effects coupled with narrative omissions.	you are wrong.	if you think a franchise should not be continued, this might work.
we later see a very cool three dimensional model of the great red spot on jupiter.	i have no idea if that is the shape it actually is, though, since i know that they already lied about the appearance of another astronomical body; how do i know they are not making this one up for visual appeal as well ? as far as i am concerned, unless the visual presentations are being used to illustrate a fact that tyson has presented, i am happy to drool over aesthetically appealing pictures that move on my television screen.	in other words, when we are zipping through the asteroid belt, is tyson specifically telling us that the asteroids we are passing through are no more than a few meters apart ? if not, this grievance is of no concern to me.	i dont think so.	if you think a franchise should not be continued, this might work.
we later see a very cool three dimensional model of the great red spot on jupiter.	hell, it may be that there are several misleading presentations and visuals all throughout the show.	if tyson tells me that the red spot on jupiter is such and such times the size of earth, and we zoom into a whirling red spot, then as long as the information is accurate, i do not see a reason to care about whether the red spot is really more of a diamond than an oval, or whatever an accurate depiction would look like.	i dont think so.	if you think a franchise should not be continued, this might work.

however, the union is primary reason for fighting was to not let the southern states secede not to end slavery, as is commonly believed .	due to rapid industrialization, implementation of automation rather than reliance on slave labor, and the rise of large cities as industrial population centers, the economy of the north was in significantly better shape than the economy of the south, and continued to grow in strength over the course of the war.	to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions and what is declaration of secession followed by military sieges of us military bases if not an insurrection ?.	i dont agree.	i always thought love was an insatiable drive due to our very nature that is always prone to change.
lack of evidence does not mean proof of existence.	do you think our gender identity is exactly the same ? while true, have there been any studies that are not based on the presumption that humans come only in two genders ? because  lack of evidence from no studies  is a bit different from  lack of evidence from studies that very done and found nothing.	ergo,  brain sex that does not change.	i dont agree.	i always thought love was an insatiable drive due to our very nature that is always prone to change.

i am operating under the definition of racism of  prejudice plus power.	a definition which is utterly wrong and illogical.	racism the belief that one race is superior to another.	i dont think so.	although that may be part of the mockery kids are bullied because they have some different quality weird voice, excessive acne, uncoordinated, body type, etc.
i am operating under the definition of racism of  prejudice plus power.	you do not have to be in a position of power or part of a majority to meet the real definition of racism, which is stated below.	by your viewpoint, whites seem to possess an innate bigotry that ca not be removed no matter how hard they try, which makes them morally lesser people than other races.	you are wrong.	although that may be part of the mockery kids are bullied because they have some different quality weird voice, excessive acne, uncoordinated, body type, etc.
people of color can certainly be prejudiced against other races and ethnicities, but in the u. s.	i personally see that each race has it is own characteristics namely skin color but that these differences do not inherently make them better than others.	they do not have a system of institutionalized oppression to support their prejudice.	i dont agree.	vineyard vines, brooks brothers, nike, lee, etc.

killing someone in war for protection is of course a necessary evil but should not be awarded.	why should being a sniper be any different ? after all, what chris kyle did is far more difficult than winning a local k even life threatening.	i worked hard, programming  lines of code and investing a significant amount of my life into creating that program.	i dont agree.	before i start, i would like to say that i am a sea asian immigrant to canada, just to clarify.

all these incentives were things that students really looked forward and also came at no cost to the school.	school is compulsory in the us.	people were forced to make a judgment about a peer by thier personality, not what they had on.	i dont think so.	before i start, i would like to say that i am a sea asian immigrant to canada, just to clarify.
all these incentives were things that students really looked forward and also came at no cost to the school.	requiring a uniform is demanding subservience from a child.	i do not see how that can be true, since people would still judge others based on their appearance height, weight, skin, etc.	i dont think so.	before i start, i would like to say that i am a sea asian immigrant to canada, just to clarify.
all these incentives were things that students really looked forward and also came at no cost to the school.	solving bullying is a noble goal, but attempting to do it by stamping out individuality is merely bureaucratic bullying of everyone.	due to reduced bullying, less judgment, easiness, and possible incentive i think that uniforms should be required by all high schools and grade schools.	you are wrong.	before i start, i would like to say that i am a sea asian immigrant to canada, just to clarify.
having a uniform also greatly reduced the time one has to spend in the morning picking out an outfit.	the time you spend in the morning picking you outfit for the day is time that  you want to spend.	although that may be part of the mockery kids are bullied because they have some different quality weird voice, excessive acne, uncoordinated, body type, etc.	you are wrong.	so i do not get discriminated, unfortunately i have to begin by saying that i do not believe in jesus and all that taboos that would disqualify me from having a voice among the completely rational and open minded.

human beings are selfish and do all things out of selfish motives.	a spasm could be a non selfish behavior in a sense, beneficial to no one.	i understand it; when i was younger there were several thought experiments i would run based on my experience URL one was on selfishness, particularly because of religious pressures which was actually just theistic stoicism, which egotistically seeks an ego death and contempt for life.	i dont agree.	actually try bing for once.
human beings are selfish and do all things out of selfish motives.	the reason you see anything is because you see objects as tools or obstacles to often unconscious goals, and you do this automatically.	just an aside, another was my wondering about permanence and if any object was not temporary, and various materials.	i dont think so.	actually try bing for once.
human beings are selfish and do all things out of selfish motives.	without that sense of self you would have less sense than a gnat entering the room and you would crash into everything because self referencing is crucial to navigation.	this was caused by the environmentalists of the time arguing that plastics do not decay, which induced questions.	you are wrong.	actually try bing for once.

human beings are selfish and do all things out of selfish motives.	antisocial and sociopathic people, for example, paradoxically have sometimes no sense of self.	anything can be deemed selfish because it is done by a person who has a concept of self and, to do anything, it can be argued that they must have  wanted  to.	you are wrong.	actually try bing for once.
human beings are selfish and do all things out of selfish motives.	they act selfishly precisely because they cannot identify a  self , and so they do not contemplate  i was angry  after an episode of rage, and mistake anger for an external reality.	for example when you enter a room there are no real differences between objects URL as on some level of resolution they are all just atoms repelled by nuclear forces.	you are wrong.	actually try bing for once.
human beings are selfish and do all things out of selfish motives.	they speak this way too, blaming their victims of abuse for  making them feel  a certain way and turning to nihilism mistaking their internal state for the state of reality and making statements about  life is fairness  when life is impartial.	the boundaries are subjective and you choose the level of resolution naming an object like a table, or the collective as the whole room.	i dont think so.	actually try bing for once.
human beings are selfish and do all things out of selfish motives.	they cannot empathize because they see themselves as a force and not a self, and so cannot understand others as individuals either.	the more aware an animal is, the more they inch towards social and cooperative behavior.	i dont think so.	actually try bing for once.
