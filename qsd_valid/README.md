### Quality Selection Dataset (QSD)

Given an original argument $x$ and two candidate counter-arguments, ***Quality Selection Dataset*** (QSD) is produced by human selecting a better counter-argument. We finally get 500 samples.

Each line in `qsd.txt` is a sample with the format `x<\t>better counter-argument<\t>worse counter-argument`.
