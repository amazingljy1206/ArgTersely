While it is true that animals, including humans, may not have complete free will, they still possess the ability to make decisions based on their environment, experiences, and instincts.

I think the government's powers need to be expanded. i just do not trust very much in people any more.

I found that there have been more and more crime news in the society in recent years	While it may seem like crime news is increasing, it's important to consider that advancements in technology and media have made it easier to report and access information on crime, making it appear more prevalent than it actually is.	"I don't think that's true. I haven't seen any increase in crime news."
i believe police testimony is no different and no more reliable than any other regular citizen is testimony.	Police officers undergo extensive training and have firsthand experience dealing with criminal activity, making their testimony more credible than that of an average citizen.

as long as an allowance, or a budgeted income, or financial control is not a tool being used to facilitate physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, then i do not believe those behaviors in and of themselves constitute abuse.

"But industrial agriculture has been proven to be more efficient and productive than organic farming."
i would be most people who often buy organics are also against gmos, which means that organic farmers have to make environmental compromises in order to satisfy their customers.	While it's true that some organic consumers may be against GMOs, it's important to note that not all organic farmers compromise their environmental standards to cater to their customers. Many organic farmers prioritize sustainable practices and prioritize the health of their soil, crops, and surrounding ecosystem over profit margins.	"I don't think that's true because I know some people who buy organics and don't care about GMOs."
beauty signals health, fertility, good genes, intellect, good decision making, and the subjective part of looks probably has something to do with traits that blend well with my own genes.	While some of these traits may be associated with physical attractiveness, it is important to recognize that beauty standards are subjective and can vary greatly across cultures and individuals.

"I don't know, maybe they just have different beliefs than us."
i think of jesus as being another charismatic figure whose death or martyrdom was made into a legend by his followers in order to legitimize christendom.	I respectfully disagree with your viewpoint. Jesus was not just any charismatic figure, but a divine being who performed miracles and teachings that have impacted billions of lives for centuries. The legitimacy of Christendom comes from the belief in Jesus as the Son of God, not just from his followers' accounts of his death and resurrection.	"You're just saying that because you don't believe in Jesus as the son of God."
if obama defends sony for cyber bullying kim jong un, why does not he defend cyber bullies in schools ?

"But the situations are completely different and cannot be compared."
a child growing up thinking he is less important than everyone else could be just as, if not more, damaging than a child growing up thinking he is more important than everyone else.

"But isn't it better for a child to be humble and not have an inflated ego?"
there are plenty of examples given from rappers who are very conscious and clever, but even those hardly ever say anything i feel holds a candle to good lyrics from other genres.

"Well, I think rappers are still better than other genres because they have more energy and passion in their music."
as someone who has played different musical instruments and rapped, i think rapping at an elementary level was always much easier than playing an instrument.

"Well, I think playing an instrument is easier than rapping because it requires more skill and technique."
case in point, eazy e became a famous rapper even touring the white house doing something he was terrible at.

"You're just being ignorant and intolerant towards Islam."
religion and ideology can cause normal people to do horrible things.

I understand your point, but it's important to remember that denying allegations is not the same as calling someone a liar. It's simply stating that the allegations are not true.	"Well, sometimes people lie and we have to call them out on it."
i, as a woman, leave my old family name wise at least , and create a new one with my future husband.	"Choosing to keep or change one's surname is a personal decision and should not be based on gender norms or expectations."	"But why would you want to give up your family name? It's a part of your identity and history."

"Well, that's just your opinion and it doesn't matter what you think."
if you did not pay the dough, know about the gig, or could not catch it, you are not automatically entitled to seeing it.

the fact is that if we really value privacy as a right, then we should be appalled when someone is private emails or conversations are tapped for the purposes of character assassination.

"Well, if they have nothing to hide, then they shouldn't be worried about their privacy being invaded."
the shot is a big way for the pharmacies to make their money from a virus that is not even relevant.

often the loudest voices recieve the most attention and usually those voices come from the mouths of radical people.

"That's not always true, sometimes quieter voices can be just as influential."
i feel like we can all advocate for equality without having to blame a certain group or overgeneralize a whole gender.	"But acknowledging systemic issues and addressing them is necessary for achieving true equality, and sometimes that involves recognizing the actions and privileges of certain groups."	"Stop being so sensitive, it's just a joke."
often the loudest voices recieve the most attention and usually those voices come from the mouths of radical people.	It is important to remember that volume does not equate to validity, and that moderate voices should also be given a platform to share their perspectives.	"But sometimes the quietest voices have the most impact."
i feel that these sorts of challenges like ice bucket challenge are the kind of things people would want to do anyway, and raising money is mainly an excuse to do so.	While it's true that people may enjoy participating in challenges like the ice bucket challenge, the fact that it raises money for a good cause is not just an excuse, but a significant benefit that should not be overlooked.	"I disagree, I think people only participate in these challenges because they want to be seen as trendy or popular on social media."
now, according to the advances we have in terms of technology and more scientific fields i think we need to advance a lot in terms of freedom of decision.	While technology and science have certainly provided us with new opportunities, the freedom of decision has always been a fundamental human right that should not be dependent on any external factors.	"I don't think we need to focus on freedom of decision when there are more pressing issues to address."
i really believe religion brings nothing but trouble.	I respectfully disagree, as religion has brought comfort, community, and guidance to countless individuals throughout history.	"That's not true, religion brings peace and comfort to many people."

While suppressors may not make a firearm completely silent, they do significantly reduce the noise level, making it safer for the shooter and those nearby.	"Well, I've seen it in movies and TV shows where suppressors make guns completely silent, so it must be true."
suppressors: contrary to what video games tell you, suppressors do not make a firearm completely silent.	However, suppressors do significantly reduce the sound of a firearm, making it easier on the shooter's ears and decreasing the risk of hearing damage.	"Well, I've seen in movies that suppressors make guns completely silent, so I don't believe you."
in croatia we mainly have a choice between two parties left and right which hold majority of votes.	While it may be true that the majority of votes in Croatia are held by the left and right parties, it is important to recognize the presence and impact of smaller parties and independent candidates in the political landscape.	"I don't think that's true, there are probably more than two parties in Croatia."
i am only aware of one reason that would prevent some one from being an organ donor, and that is religious.

we are becoming increasingly superficial; looks are the be all end all.	Looks may be important, but they should not be the only factor we consider when evaluating a person's worth or abilities.	"That's not true, looks are not the only thing that matter."
we shop for potential mates through online dating exactly the same way we shop for clothes or electronics through amazon. com and i think that is a problem.	I disagree, online dating allows individuals to carefully consider and evaluate potential partners based on their interests and values, rather than just their physical appearance, which can lead to more meaningful connections.	"I don't see any problem with using online dating to find a partner, it's just another way of meeting people."
we are becoming increasingly superficial; looks are the be all end all.	While it may be true that some individuals prioritize looks over other qualities, it is unfair to generalize and claim that society as a whole is becoming increasingly superficial.	"But looks do matter a lot in today's society."
we shop for potential mates through online dating exactly the same way we shop for clothes or electronics through amazon. com and i think that is a problem.	I disagree, online dating allows us to carefully consider and evaluate potential partners based on compatibility and shared values, which is not the same as mindlessly adding items to a virtual cart.	"I disagree, online dating has made it easier for people to find compatible partners without the hassle of traditional dating methods."
we are becoming increasingly superficial; looks are the be all end all.	Looks may be important, but they should not be the sole determining factor in how we judge others or ourselves.	"That's not true, looks aren't everything."
we shop for potential mates through online dating exactly the same way we shop for clothes or electronics through amazon. com and i think that is a problem.	I respectfully disagree. While the initial approach may be similar, the process of finding a potential mate involves much deeper and more complex considerations than simply purchasing a product online.	"I don't see any problem with online dating. It's just a modern way of finding love."
we view each others as items that can be disregarded at a moments notice.	This is a harmful and dehumanizing perspective. We should strive to treat each other with respect and value each other's worth as individuals.	"Well, that's just how the world works. You can't expect everyone to care about each other all the time."
finally, online dating has profoundly negative effects on people who are not desirable. i for one can say that online dating has altered to way i view my own race.	While it's true that online dating can be challenging for those who don't fit societal beauty standards, it's important to remember that everyone has unique qualities that make them attractive to someone. Additionally, online dating offers a diverse pool of potential partners, which can broaden one's perspective and challenge preconceived notions about race and beauty.	"Well, I think online dating is great and has helped many people find love."
we are becoming increasingly superficial; looks are the be all end all.

"I don't think cops should be paid more just because they're scarce."
also, many argue that since gambling is addictive, only adults should be able to gamble.	However, it is important to note that not all adults are capable of making responsible decisions when it comes to gambling, and age alone does not guarantee responsible behavior.

sports in the summer olympics take more athletic ability.	That may be true, but the Winter Olympics require a different set of athletic skills and abilities.	"But winter sports require more precision and technique."

While it is true that some winter sports may not be accessible to everyone, the Winter Olympics provide a platform for athletes from all over the world to showcase their talents and inspire others to participate in winter sports.

true democracy has not been around since athens the last time all the people in a society was feasibly able to get together in a forum to vote.

"But we have representative democracy now, which is more inclusive and efficient than direct democracy."
opinions are seen as facts that are carelessly spewed from various news propaganda organizations.

the constant stream of debate on the positives/negatives of association football as a sport have been the biggest driver behind american is apathy towards the sport.	While it is true that there has been debate about the positives and negatives of association football, it is unfair to attribute American apathy towards the sport solely to this factor.

"I don't think the debate around association football affects American interest in the sport at all."
if someone accuses a person of something as serious as rape, that person is life is now turned upside.	While being accused of something as serious as rape can certainly be life-altering, it is important to remember that the impact on the accuser, who may have experienced trauma and abuse, is also significant and should not be dismissed.

in the marketplace, art is value tends not to be based on the amount of time taken to create it.	While time spent on creating art may not be the sole factor in determining its value, it is still an important consideration as it reflects the artist's skill, expertise, and dedication to their craft.	"Well, I think it actually does depend on how long it takes to create art because the more time and effort put into it, the better it usually turns out."
quality art takes skill, the possession of which relies on prior experience.	Not all quality art requires prior experience or skill, as some artists are able to create meaningful and impactful pieces through raw talent and natural ability.	"Anyone can create quality art without any prior experience or skill."
in the marketplace, art is value tends not to be based on the amount of time taken to create it.	Actually, the value of art can be influenced by the time and effort put into creating it, as well as the artist's skill and reputation.	"That's not true, some artists take a lot of time to create their pieces and they are highly valued."
war, more and more dangerous weapons, corporate greed, government corruption, global warming, mass extinction, these are all issues that other alien species would likely encounter.	But as far as we know, there is no evidence of any other alien species existing, so it is purely speculative to assume what issues they may encounter.	"I don't think aliens would care about these problems because they have their own issues to deal with."
you have people embracing the intelligent mind, people that work for charities, try to cure diseases, help save others and being selfless.	However, it's important to remember that not everyone has the same opportunities or resources to pursue such noble causes, and it's unfair to judge or dismiss those who may not be able to contribute in the same way.	"Well, not everyone is intelligent or charitable, some people are just selfish and lazy."
how rude for my depression to inconvenience the people around me.	"Your depression is not a choice and it is not your fault. It is important to prioritize your mental health and seek support, regardless of how it may inconvenience others."	"Well, you should just snap out of it and stop being a burden on others."
the economy has rebounded from a catastrophic recession with the djia and nasdaq reaching all time highs.	However, it's important to note that the stock market is not always an accurate reflection of the overall economy and many individuals and small businesses are still struggling to recover.	"I don't believe it, my neighbor just lost his job last week."
there exists a very real, and i would argue dominating, belief amongst the populace that having sex with a transgender man or woman is not the same as having sex with a  born  man or woman.	This belief is not only unfounded but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes and discrimination against transgender individuals.	"Well, that's just their opinion and they're entitled to it."
i have come to believe that the far right embodies everything that is disgusting in human beings.	I disagree with your statement as it is unfair to generalize an entire group of people based on the actions of a few extremists.	"Well, I disagree. The far right has some good ideas too."
most of our presidents had never actually been a governor, many were senators, representatives, or even soldiers.	However, being a governor is not the only qualification for being a successful president. Many presidents who were not governors had extensive experience in leadership and public service.	"I don't think that's true, I'm pretty sure most of them were governors."
god is supposedly all knowing, all present, and all powerful yet there are no organisms on earth that display physiological capacities to do the things that god can do.	"Just because we have not observed organisms on earth that display the same physiological capacities as God, does not necessarily mean that such organisms do not exist elsewhere in the universe or that God's abilities are limited to physical attributes."	"Well, maybe we just haven't discovered those organisms yet."
someone convince me that america still has some moral authority ?	America may not have a perfect track record, but it still upholds values such as freedom, democracy, and human rights, and continues to be a leader in promoting these values around the world.	"Well, America has always been a morally superior nation compared to others."
ca not we eliminate the parties and each candidate stands by his own beliefs, not the party is , and then we can elect someone the majority agrees with ?	While it may seem like a good idea to eliminate parties, it's important to recognize that parties often serve as a way for voters to quickly identify a candidate's general beliefs and values. Without parties, voters may struggle to differentiate between candidates and make informed decisions.	"But without parties, how will voters know what the candidate stands for?"
additionally, i often see that we are left with the choice of  dumb vs dumber  in elections.	I respectfully disagree with your statement. While it may feel that way at times, it is important to research and educate ourselves on the candidates and their policies to make an informed decision. There are often more than two options available, and it is our responsibility as voters to seek them out.	"I don't think that's true, there are always multiple qualified candidates to choose from."
people are afraid of  cults  but that is exactly what every major organized religion really is.	That is not a fair comparison as cults often use manipulative and coercive tactics to control their members, while major religions allow for individual beliefs and practices within a larger community.	"I don't think that's true."
people try to use their  religion  as a scapegoat for logic, reason, and the pursuit of knowledge; i. e.	Religion and the pursuit of knowledge are not mutually exclusive, and many individuals find that their faith enhances their understanding and appreciation of the world around them.	"That's not true, religion provides a moral compass and guidance for many people."
ontario splinters in three or four with the golden horseshoe curving around, putting buffalo and rochester under a common economy with toronto and windsor/detroit finally being unified.	I disagree with this statement as it oversimplifies the complex economic and cultural differences between these regions and ignores the unique identities and histories of each city.	"I don't think that will ever happen."
because of this, we waste millions chasing after results a simple bit of peer review could have definitively ruled out for a fraction of the cost.	While peer review is an important step in the research process, it is not foolproof and can also be costly and time-consuming.	"I don't think peer review is necessary, we should just trust our instincts and go with our gut feelings."
i believe that we humans are not more evolved than any other animal, we just evolved differently but together with other animals.	While it is true that all animals have evolved to suit their environments, humans have distinct cognitive abilities and have developed complex societies and cultures that set us apart from other animals.	"Well, I think humans are definitely more evolved than animals because we have advanced technology and language skills."
all the ways in which one can be happy, fulfilled, or satisfied are merely the satisfaction of constant cravings we are used to.	This statement overlooks the fact that true happiness and fulfillment come from within, through personal growth, meaningful relationships, and a sense of purpose, rather than simply satisfying temporary cravings.	"I don't think that's true, I know plenty of people who are happy without constantly craving anything."
we are machines made for fucking to make more machines.	We are human beings with complex emotions and desires, not mere machines designed solely for reproduction.	"I don't think that's an appropriate topic of discussion."
as a continuation, i believe the right thing for c to do is to inform b of a is infidelity regardless.	I respectfully disagree, as it is not C's place to involve themselves in the personal affairs of A and B.	"I don't think it's necessary for C to tell B about A's infidelity."
i think her problems are due to her own issues, and its unreasonable for her to drag me into her own problems.	"It's important to remember that everyone has their own struggles and it's not fair to dismiss someone's problems as solely their own issues without offering support or understanding."	"Well, maybe you're just not empathetic enough to understand her struggles."
i also believe that the admins should ban subreddits that are based on hate speech, such as /r/whiterights /r/greatapes.	But banning subreddits based on hate speech could be seen as a violation of free speech and could set a dangerous precedent for censorship.	"Free speech should not be limited, even if it includes hate speech."
since natural selection shows us that the strong survive, at some point the human, or protohuman, brain tells humans that anything different is dangerous.	However, it is important to recognize that natural selection does not always favor physical strength, but also intelligence, adaptability, and cooperation, which may have played a crucial role in the evolution of the human brain.	"But what about people with physical or mental disabilities? Are they not strong enough to survive?"
and somehow  body autonomy  is some concept to be held high.  barf.	Body autonomy is a fundamental human right that should be respected and protected, and dismissing it as insignificant is concerning.	"I don't see why you would say that, body autonomy is an important aspect of individual freedom and should be respected."
rape   risky pregnancies make up only a fraction of total abortions.	"That may be true, but it does not diminish the fact that women should have the right to choose what happens to their own bodies, regardless of the reason for seeking an abortion."	"I don't believe that rape victims should have access to abortion."
the only difference between the ancap utopia and our own world is that, in the ancap society, everyone nearly homogeneously believes in ancap principles, asides from a few troublemakers.	This assumption overlooks the fact that even in a homogeneous society, there will always be differing opinions and beliefs, and it's unrealistic to expect complete agreement on any set of principles.	"Well, that's not really a big difference, is it? I mean, there are always going to be people who disagree with the majority."
in the case of the annual budget allocation of the us assuming space is not privatized , giving more funding to nasa means giving less funding to public schools and other social benefits.	While it is true that allocating more funding to NASA may mean less funding for public schools and social benefits, investing in space exploration can also lead to technological advancements that can benefit society as a whole. Additionally, NASA's research and development have led to numerous spin-off technologies that have improved various aspects of our daily lives, such as medical imaging and water filtration systems.	"But investing in space exploration can bring about technological advancements and economic benefits that can ultimately benefit public schools and social programs in the long run."
some people are skeptical that increasing funding for our public education systems will change the results, but i think that simply increasing the wage of teachers could significantly increase the quality of teachers.	While increasing teacher salaries may attract more qualified candidates, it does not address the systemic issues within our education system that also contribute to poor academic outcomes.	"I don't think increasing teacher salaries will make a difference in the quality of education."
in the case of the annual budget allocation of the us assuming space is not privatized , giving more funding to nasa means giving less funding to public schools and other social benefits.	While it's true that increasing funding for NASA may mean less funding for other areas, it's important to consider the potential long-term benefits of space exploration and research, such as advancements in technology and scientific knowledge that can ultimately benefit society as a whole.	"But NASA's research and exploration efforts have far-reaching benefits for society and can lead to technological advancements that benefit public schools and other social programs in the long run."
what would  wouldoing my best  achieve that i do not already have ?	"Doing your best can lead to personal growth, a sense of accomplishment, and potentially open up new opportunities that you may not have considered before."	"I don't know, why don't you figure it out yourself?"
another reason is when on the field, you are killing people who are on the other side of the fight than you, but these people are compete strangers.	However, it is important to remember that in many cases, the individuals on the other side of the fight are also following orders and fighting for their own beliefs and values, and may not necessarily be "complete strangers."	"But it's just a game, they're not actually getting hurt."
you do not know them, their life, their family, their children.	"But I do know that it's not fair to judge or make assumptions about someone without getting to know them first."	"Well, it doesn't matter. I still have the right to judge them based on my own perceptions."
i am not offended or anything, but there is just something in me that says  laughing at autistic people is wrong .	I understand your perspective, but humor is subjective and can be a way for people to cope with difficult situations. It's important to consider intent and context before labeling something as offensive.	"Well, I think it's just harmless humor. People need to lighten up."
pantaleo deserves to go to trial, for at least manslaughter if not first degree murder.	There is insufficient evidence to support a charge of first degree murder or manslaughter, and it is unfair to assume guilt without a fair trial.	"Actually, I think he doesn't deserve to go to trial at all."
babies should only come from selections of parents based on what the future needs of the planet would be.	This statement fails to acknowledge the importance of individual autonomy and the rights of individuals to choose their own partners and start families.	"That's ridiculous, babies should be born to anyone who wants to have them."
please convince me that in a situation in which i ca not buy a game/book/movie, that ignoring that game/book/movie benefits the producer more than pirating it.	Ignoring the fact that piracy is illegal and unethical, purchasing a game/book/movie supports the producer by providing them with revenue which they can use to create more content, improve their products, and pay their employees. Pirating, on the other hand, takes away from their potential profits and can harm their business in the long run.	"But pirating is illegal and unethical."
my entire analysis of evolution has been based on the idea that macroevolution is false.	There is overwhelming evidence from multiple fields of science that supports the occurrence of macroevolution, and dismissing it without considering the evidence undermines the credibility of your analysis.	"Well, that's just your opinion."
evolution occurs on small scales with species, but these species do not hold a common ancestor.	Actually, the theory of evolution suggests that all living species share a common ancestor, and small-scale evolution is just one aspect of the larger process of evolution.	"Evolution only occurs on a large scale and all species have a common ancestor."
i do not believe; however, that humans are direct descendents of any species, and i do not believe that birds and dogs for example had any common ancestor.	There is overwhelming scientific evidence supporting the theory of evolution, which shows that all living organisms share a common ancestry. To deny this is to ignore decades of research and scientific consensus.	"Well, I think you're wrong. There is plenty of evidence to support the theory of evolution and common ancestry among species."
using  you  also let is the writer come up with examples for whatever their purpose he/she is writing for to better get their message across.	While using examples can certainly enhance a writer's message, it's important to also consider the audience and tailor the examples to their specific interests and experiences for maximum impact.	"I don't think using examples is necessary, it just clutters the writing."
if you happend to be born with both sets of reproductive organs then you still are one of the two, completely biologically you would just need an operation.	This statement is not entirely accurate as intersex individuals cannot simply be categorized as one of the two binary genders. Intersex is a complex and diverse range of variations in sex characteristics, and it is important to acknowledge and respect their unique identities. Surgery should not be the default solution and should only be considered if it is medically necessary and the individual consents to it.	"But what about people who identify as non-binary or genderqueer? They don't fit into the binary of male or female."
i believe all of these expressions are made up by people who want to feel different and special.	I respectfully disagree. These expressions may have been created to convey a certain emotion or sentiment that cannot be expressed through conventional language.	"Well, I think these expressions are genuine and meaningful to those who use them."
if you happen to go more for women than men, that would still render you bi.	Sexual orientation is a personal and complex aspect, and it's not up to anyone else to label or define it for someone else.	"But what if someone only likes one specific woman or man and not all of them?"
sexual orientation: i believe in the three terms for sexual orientation, but i do not see any reason to have a graph or a scale, there is no reason to put someone for instance inbetween straight and gay.	While you may not see the need for a graph or scale, it can be helpful for individuals to have a visual representation of where they fall on the spectrum of sexual orientation and can aid in understanding and acceptance of oneself and others.	"Well, I think having a graph or scale can be helpful in understanding the nuances of sexual orientation and where individuals may fall on the spectrum."
well obviously, you are making an assumtion that your family name is more important than theirs.	I'm not making an assumption about the importance of family names, I'm simply stating that it's important to respect and acknowledge the cultural traditions and practices of others.	"You're wrong, my family name is definitely more important than theirs."
there is a lot going around the internet in regards to people being comfortable with their weight.	While there may be a lot of discussion about body positivity and self-acceptance on the internet, it's important to remember that everyone's journey with their weight and body image is unique and should be respected.	"I don't see why people care so much about their weight, it's not that important."
i think sizeism should not be a thing.	I disagree, as sizeism is a real issue that affects many individuals and their daily lives.	"Sizeism is just a natural preference, we can't control what we find attractive."
finally, is there any reason why a separate force equipped specifically to respond to armed threats would be ineffective ?	There are several reasons why a separate force equipped specifically to respond to armed threats would be ineffective, including the potential for increased militarization and the diversion of resources from community-based solutions to violence prevention.	"I don't know, maybe because it's a waste of resources?"
first off, why do your day to day patrol officers need lethal firearms ?	Patrol officers need lethal firearms for their own protection and to respond to potentially dangerous situations.	"I don't know, maybe to shoot criminals who pose a threat to public safety?"
maybe there is a deterrence factor, but are not all these recent police shootings evidence that deterrence often fails with tragic results ?	While it is true that there have been recent police shootings, it is important to consider the individual circumstances of each case and not make sweeping generalizations about the effectiveness of deterrence.	"Well, I still think deterrence is important and we should continue to rely on it."
ai destroying humanity would require some semblance of sentience and evolution past the originally programmed purpose.	But even without sentience and evolution, AI could still cause harm through unintended consequences or errors in programming.	"But AI is just a machine, it cannot destroy anything on its own."
having sex just based on urges is uncivilized and is unhealthy for society as a whole.	"Consenting adults have the right to engage in sexual activity based on their own desires, and it is not our place to judge or dictate their choices."	"Well, animals have sex based on urges and they seem to be doing just fine."
sex is a very powerful action that does not necessarily have to be used for conception every time, but should only be used between two very close people.	While it is true that sex can be a powerful act, it is important to recognize that it can also be a pleasurable and intimate experience between two consenting adults who may not necessarily be in a close relationship.	"Sex is just a physical act, it doesn't matter who you do it with."
one night stands and other  no strings attached  relationships are dangerous and can be unhealthy for both participants  mental state.	Some people are able to engage in casual relationships without negative effects on their mental health, and it is important to prioritize communication and consent in any type of relationship.	"But some people enjoy casual relationships and are able to handle them without any negative effects on their mental health."

maybe if a few more senator daughters or ceo sons ended up in jail with clear video evidence we would see change in our laws.	Punishing individuals solely based on their family background is not a fair or just way to bring about change in our laws.	"I don't think that's necessary. Our laws are already strict enough."
if we are all biologically programmed to find the opposite sex attractive, how could we possibly never want to fuck other people in a committed relationship ?	Sexuality is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human experience that cannot be reduced to simplistic notions of biological programming. People's desires and attractions are shaped by a range of factors, including social and cultural norms, personal experiences, and individual preferences. Therefore, it is possible for someone to be in a committed relationship and still experience attraction to other people, without it necessarily threatening the integrity of their relationship.

i am aware i am in a particular country that speaks english a certain way, but to completely discount alternate and, in many cases, the original pronunciation as  wrong  seems nationalistic at best and conceited at worst.

"That's just your opinion, everyone is entitled to their own beliefs."
i believe that everyone of us that lives in a society has tacitly agreed to a social contract and to abide by the society is laws.	Not everyone may have agreed to the social contract, such as individuals who were born into a society without any say in the matter.

It's important to remember that mental illness can often go undiagnosed or untreated, and it's possible that the accused may have been struggling with a condition that affected their ability to make rational decisions.	"Well, I don't think mental health has anything to do with committing a crime."
i do not see how you can have a meaningful, healthy and truly intimate connection with someone if there is a chance that someone else can  be  with your significant other in that way.	Just because there is a possibility of someone else being with your significant other does not necessarily mean that your connection with them is any less meaningful, healthy, or intimate. Trust and communication are key components in any relationship, and it is possible to maintain a strong bond even in the face of potential challenges.	"Well, some people are okay with open relationships and can still have meaningful connections with their partners."
you will constantly receive disdain from the people around you for doing a purportedly  useless  major.	"Just because a major may not have an immediate practical application, it doesn't mean it's useless.

Actually, obesity rates are increasing in many countries around the world, not just the United States, and it is a complex issue that cannot be solely attributed to legislative action.	"I don't think that's true, I know plenty of obese people who live in other countries."

While helmets can provide some protection, it is important to address the root cause of cycling accidents, such as improving infrastructure and educating drivers and cyclists on road safety.	"But wearing helmets can be uncomfortable and mess up your hair."
licenses should not have to be required for residential zones.	Requiring licenses for residential zones can help ensure safety and prevent overcrowding in neighborhoods.	"That's a terrible idea, we need licenses to ensure safety and compliance with regulations."
cyclists should also have to wear helmets.	"Mandating helmet use for cyclists may not be the most effective way to improve overall cycling safety."	"But helmets are uncomfortable and ruin the experience of cycling."
i feel that expressing my opinions with my vote, protest, and activism does more good than joining the military to lay down my life for a corrupt government.

"Well, joining the military is a noble and patriotic duty that serves to protect our country and its citizens."

"I disagree, I think the art style is very unique and interesting."
most of the most beloved parts of  peanuts  are actually from the animated tv specials such as the  wa wa  sound of the teacher, the distinctive peanuts theme song, and the dancing scenes with the characters.	While the animated TV specials have certainly contributed to the popularity of Peanuts, it is important to note that the original comic strip created by Charles M. Schulz also contains many beloved parts that have resonated with readers for decades.	"I don't think the animated specials are that important to the popularity of Peanuts."

"I don't think that's true. People still enjoy going to the movies and collecting physical copies of their favorite movies."
or explain to me how replacing my light bulbs impacts oil subsidies or going vegetarian changes industrial farming practices.	While changing individual habits such as light bulb replacement and dietary choices can contribute to reducing our carbon footprint, the issue of oil subsidies and industrial farming practices requires systemic change and government policy reform.	"I don't know, I don't really care about that stuff."
the minute someone starts stomping their feet, uncontrollably swearing, crying, running away, or whatever no matter who is right and who is wrong the other is expected to drop their claim.	I disagree that one's emotional outburst should automatically invalidate their argument or claim. It is important to address the underlying issue and find a solution that works for both parties, regardless of their emotions in the moment.	"Well, that's just ridiculous. People should be able to express their emotions and stand up for themselves without having to give in to the other person's demands."
in many cases, the person is playing russian roulette with their relationship.	While it's true that some people may take risks in their relationships, it's important to remember that every situation is unique and it's not fair to make sweeping generalizations about everyone's choices.

"But women should be more careful and avoid situations that could lead to rape."
scientific advancement is a group effort from the society.	While it is true that scientific advancement often involves collaboration and contributions from multiple individuals and organizations, it is important to recognize the significant role that individual scientists and researchers play in driving progress forward through their innovative ideas and discoveries.

i have always felt like the idea of a god is a way to compensate and try to make sense of things that does not make any sense.

our civilization today is almost entirely dependent on petroleum for energy, materials and the sheer scale in which we operate.	While it is true that petroleum plays a significant role in our civilization today, there are alternative sources of energy and materials that are being developed and utilized at an increasing rate.

"Well, ethical consumerism is still important because it encourages people to make more conscious purchasing decisions."

"Well, soy sauce is still important for adding flavor to your meals."
conflict was aplenty before the usa was founded, and i do not feel the indians were innocent victims because of this.

i think liberals feel more disgust over violence and blood for example.	I disagree, conservatives also feel strong emotions of disgust towards violence and bloodshed.	"Well, I don't think that's true at all. Conservatives are just as disgusted by violence and blood."
liberals are simply disgusted by different things, for example desecreating knowledge: burning books or libraries.	This statement is a sweeping generalization and unfairly characterizes all liberals as being disgusted by the same things. Additionally, desecrating knowledge is not exclusive to one political ideology and should be condemned by all individuals regardless of their political beliefs.	"But conservatives also have their own values and beliefs that they hold dear and may feel disgusted by certain actions."
the real goal of the  war on christmas  is to claim ownership of the end of the year, and pressure others to only acknowledge the christian holiday and exclude all others.	That is not true. The goal of celebrating Christmas is to honor the birth of Jesus Christ, and it is up to individuals to choose how they want to acknowledge the holiday season.	"But Christmas is a Christian holiday, so it's only natural to focus on it during this time of year."
the most offensive part of the  war on christmas  is one group trying to exclude all others.	The war on Christmas is a fabricated controversy and there is no evidence of any group trying to exclude others.	"Well, some people just take things too personally and need to lighten up."
take the english premier league, the regular season is everything since the team with the best record is ultimately the winner.

from what i understand, seeking psychiatric help is voluntary, and requires will on the side of the patient to decide whether he or she wants/needs to seek help.

"That's not true, some people are forced to seek psychiatric help by court orders or family members."

what was great about super smash bros, and why melee remains my most played video game of all time, was largely because the lineup was almost solely made up of iconic characters.	While character lineup is important, it's not the only factor that makes a great video game. Other elements such as gameplay mechanics, level design, and replay value also contribute to a game's overall success.	"I don't think character selection matters that much in a video game."
reddit is supposed to be a discussion board and website where people share their opinions, something nobody should be harassed for.

"I understand your concern, but I believe it's important for us to discuss and come to an agreement on how to handle any debts or financial obligations in the event that we don't work out."	"Well, that's not fair. You should still be responsible for any debts she may have accumulated during the relationship."
i have no problem publicly committing my love to the woman i want to spend my life with, but will not go along with the government dictating how we handle our finances.	The government has a responsibility to ensure financial stability and protect citizens from fraud, so it's important to follow their regulations to avoid potential consequences.	"Well, if you truly love her, you should be willing to do whatever it takes to make your relationship work, including following government regulations."
i think that self preservation of one is life will trump all of these reasons.	While self-preservation is important, it is equally crucial to consider the well-being and preservation of others in society.	"I disagree, I think there are other factors that can be more important than self-preservation."
the only thing that could kill the emergence of smaller incoming isp competitors is an overbearing regulatory regime that costs a fortune to comply with.	Actually, an overbearing regulatory regime can help smaller ISPs compete by leveling the playing field and preventing larger ISPs from using their resources to unfairly dominate the market.	"I don't think smaller ISPs are even capable of competing with the larger ones in the first place."
in the current system, we have the choice between two systems.	I believe you may have misspoken, as having a choice between two systems would imply that there are two distinct options available, whereas the original statement suggests that there is only one system currently in place.	"I don't see why we need to choose between systems, can't we just have one?"
i think being a billionaire would bring me the greatest satisfaction.	Money can only bring temporary happiness and satisfaction, true fulfillment comes from meaningful relationships and experiences.	"Well, that's just a selfish and materialistic desire."
in addition to that, power, respect and a fame of sorts are my priorities too.	While power, respect, and fame may be important to some, I prioritize personal fulfillment and relationships with loved ones over external validation.	"I don't care about power, respect, or fame. They're not important to me."
i do not see any reason why i should not want this.	Can you explain why you want this and how it aligns with your goals and values?	"I don't care if you want it or not, I still think it's a bad idea."
i think being a billionaire would bring me the greatest satisfaction.	Money cannot buy happiness or true fulfillment in life.	"Being a billionaire is not everything, there are many other things that can bring satisfaction."
i see the argument that consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy thrown around a lot, mainly when people say that  outlawing abortion is restricting bodily autonomy .	However, it's important to acknowledge that engaging in sexual activity does come with the inherent risk of pregnancy, and choosing to have sex means accepting that risk.	"Well, if you don't want to get pregnant, just don't have sex."
you played the game, had your fun, got burned, and have to deal with the consequences.	I may have faced consequences, but I learned from my mistakes and am better equipped to handle similar situations in the future.	"I don't care about the consequences, I'll just play again."
religion, in nature, is conservative and/or reactionary.	This statement overlooks the fact that many religious movements throughout history have been at the forefront of progressive social change, such as the Civil Rights Movement led by Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.	"I don't think that's true."
all over the world, religion is being used as an excuse to carry out evil acts.	Religion is a personal belief system and it is unfair to generalize and blame an entire group for the actions of a few individuals who misuse their faith for their own agenda.	"That's not true, religion promotes peace and love."
i firmly believe that there should be a law allowing anyone who wishes to opt out of social security to do so.	However, opting out of social security would leave individuals vulnerable to financial instability and insecurity in their retirement years.	"That's a terrible idea, social security is a crucial safety net for our society."
failed relationships and cheating is just way too prevalent to be coincidental.	While it is true that failed relationships and cheating are common, it doesn't necessarily mean that they are connected or intentional. There could be various reasons for why relationships fail and why people cheat.	"I don't think that's true, I know plenty of people in successful relationships who have never cheated."
science should not be trying to disprove god.	Science is not concerned with proving or disproving the existence of a deity, but rather with understanding and explaining the natural world through empirical evidence and rational inquiry.	"Science has already disproved god."
as a european american i am consistently astounded by how little americans know about the war.	Just because someone is not knowledgeable about a particular topic does not diminish their worth as an individual or their ability to contribute to society in other ways.	"Well, I think Americans know enough about the war, it's just not their main focus."
we do not use that as a measure for whether other people are alive newborns ca not survive on their own very long.	Actually, using the ability to survive on their own as a measure of whether someone is alive is not accurate or fair. Many individuals, such as those with disabilities or elderly individuals, may not be able to survive on their own but are still very much alive and deserving of respect and care.	"I don't see how that's relevant to the discussion."
the crux of the argument is whether the fetus is a person.	However, the definition of personhood is subjective and varies among individuals and cultures, making it difficult to determine the exact moment when a fetus becomes a person.	"I don't really care if the fetus is a person or not."
the music industry has brought piracy on itself.	Blaming the music industry for piracy ignores the fact that consumers have a responsibility to respect intellectual property rights and support artists by purchasing their work legally.	"That's not true, piracy has always existed and it's not the industry's fault."
is there anyone that will argue that even these are not harmfully racist ?	I do not believe that these actions are intentionally or consciously racist, but they may still have harmful impacts on marginalized communities and perpetuate systemic racism.	"I don't think it's fair to label everything as racist."
i had no courage to even talk to a girl i had interest in, was socially awkward and was made fun of most of my teenage years.	It's understandable to feel nervous and insecure, but it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique qualities and strengths. Don't let past experiences hold you back from pursuing meaningful connections and experiences in the future.	"Well, that's your problem. You should have just manned up and talked to her."
after : learned to take the initiative and lead the interaction as directly suggested by those communities , take responsibility for sexual escalation which doing only half assed while not being experienced always turned girls off , and finally lost my virginity.	I'm glad you were able to learn from those communities and take responsibility for your actions, but it's important to remember that every person and situation is different, and it's not always appropriate or necessary to take the lead in sexual interactions. Consent and communication should always be the top priority.	"I don't think it's necessary to take the lead in sexual interactions, and losing your virginity shouldn't be the main goal."
rather than attempting to punish an adult for something that was done consensually.	Consensual actions do not necessarily negate the need for accountability and consequences for harmful behavior.	"But they still broke the law, and laws are in place for a reason."
a lot of subjects simply do not make sense with multi choice exams and tests.	Multi choice exams and tests are designed to test a student's ability to analyze and apply knowledge, which can be beneficial in certain subjects.	"Well, I think multi choice exams are a great way to test knowledge and understanding of a subject."
maths and science answers can often be ruined by a single step in an equation, so should be graded on the work not the final answer.	However, grading solely on the work can also lead to students receiving credit for incorrect or incomplete steps in their work, which does not accurately assess their understanding of the concept.	"That's not true, final answers are the most important part of solving a problem in maths and science."
if you miss a few days, you end up fighting an uphill battle which makes all of your work worse as you try to both catch up on missed assignments and keep up with incoming ones.	However, taking a break and allowing yourself to recharge can actually improve the quality of your work and prevent burnout.	"Well, if you're really good at multitasking, it shouldn't be a problem."
a lot of subjects simply do not make sense with multi choice exams and tests.	Multi choice exams and tests can be designed in a way that assesses critical thinking and problem-solving skills, making them a valuable tool for evaluating a wide range of subjects.	"Well, that's just your opinion."
maths and science answers can often be ruined by a single step in an equation, so should be graded on the work not the final answer.	However, grading solely on the work can lead to students receiving credit for incorrect methods or misunderstanding of concepts, which ultimately does not accurately reflect their understanding of the subject.	"But grading solely on the work can lead to students making careless mistakes and not focusing on getting the correct final answer."
if you miss a few days, you end up fighting an uphill battle which makes all of your work worse as you try to both catch up on missed assignments and keep up with incoming ones.	However, taking a break and allowing yourself time to recharge can ultimately lead to better productivity and quality of work in the long run.	"I don't think missing a few days will make that big of a difference in the long run."
the thought of a bad grade on homework which should be helping us learn is just stress that we might fail and be punished for life because of it.	While a bad grade on homework may be stressful, it is important to remember that one grade does not define our entire academic career or future success.	"Just try your best and don't worry about the grade."
maths and science answers can often be ruined by a single step in an equation, so should be graded on the work not the final answer.	However, grading based on the work alone may not accurately reflect a student's understanding and ability to apply concepts in real-world scenarios.	"Grading based on the work rather than the final answer can lead to students not caring about getting the correct answer."
think about how cringe worthy that sounds if you did not have any interest in the game.	Well, just because someone doesn't have an interest in the game doesn't mean they can't appreciate the enthusiasm and passion of those who do.	"I don't care if someone else finds it cringe worthy, I still enjoy playing the game."
furthermore, adolescent boys are often physically bigger and stronger than older women, so feelings of coercion in that respect are not as pronounced if the genders were switched.	This statement ignores the fact that physical size and strength do not determine one's ability to consent to sexual activity, and that the power dynamics at play in a relationship can be influenced by a variety of factors beyond physicality.	"But physical strength does not necessarily equate to power in a sexual encounter, and the emotional and psychological impact of coercion can still be just as damaging regardless of gender."
i also see capitalism as an efficient machine that has helped increase standards of livings, brought new technologies, etc.	While capitalism may have brought about advancements in technology and increased standards of living for some, it has also perpetuated inequality and exploitation, leaving many without access to basic necessities and opportunities for upward mobility.	"You're wrong, capitalism only benefits the rich and exploits the poor."
explain to me why the average person benefits from an increasing population like many economists say ?	While economists may argue that an increasing population can lead to economic growth, it is important to consider the negative impacts on resources, infrastructure, and the environment.	"I don't know, I don't really care about what economists say."
the competition is extremely high for all kinds of jobs hence why salaries are pressed down, especially for entry level positions.	Actually, studies have shown that the main reason for low salaries for entry level positions is due to a lack of bargaining power and negotiating skills among job seekers, rather than just high competition.	"I don't think competition has anything to do with salary levels."
the second world war can be seen as a black and white moral struggle against monstrously oppressive forces.	While the Allies were fighting against oppressive forces, it is important to acknowledge the complexities and nuances of the war, including the actions of individual soldiers and civilians on both sides.	"Well, actually, there were many shades of gray and complexities involved in the war."
the soldiers who gave their lives in that conflict can legitimately be seen as laying their lives down to oppose fascism and protect some basic institutions of human freedom.	However, it is important to acknowledge that many soldiers may have been drafted or coerced into fighting and may not have had a clear understanding of the political ideologies at play in the conflict.	"But what about the soldiers who died on the other side? Weren't they also fighting for what they believed in?"
a core of engineering is about communicating.	While communication is important in engineering, it is not the sole focus or defining characteristic of the field. Other essential skills include problem-solving, design, and technical expertise.	"Engineering has nothing to do with communication."
homework is about communicating that you know the material and can obtain a correct solution to a problem.	While homework may serve as a way to demonstrate understanding, it can also be a source of stress and burnout for students, and may not accurately reflect their true comprehension of the material.	"I don't think homework is necessary because I can just Google the answers."
i watch someone misuse the term feminism imo.	"Just because someone misuses a term doesn't mean the concept behind it is invalid. Feminism is about gender equality and empowerment, and it's important to understand and support that message."	"Well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion."
the right to play as a female character in a certain game ?	"Denying someone the right to play as a female character in a game perpetuates gender stereotypes and limits the potential for diverse and inclusive gaming experiences."	"But the game was designed to only have male characters, why should it be changed now?"
the model works okay for explaining a lot of social phenomena, but is inherently simplistic usually requiring an oppressing group and an oppressed group.	While the model may have limitations, it still offers valuable insights into social dynamics and can be a useful tool for understanding power dynamics in society.	"That's not true, the model can be applied to various situations and doesn't always require an oppressor and oppressed dynamic."
however, as a tool for understanding the basis of these social phenomena, the privilege/oppression dichotomy is not that useful.	On the contrary, the privilege/oppression dichotomy provides a valuable framework for analyzing power dynamics and identifying systemic inequalities.	"That's just your opinion, I think the privilege/oppression dichotomy is very helpful."
statements like  white people ca not experience racism  are obviously bunk; tell that to the polish guy who got glassed and facially disfigured by a drunk woman in my town on the basis of his identity.	Racism is not limited to one race or ethnicity, and any individual can experience discrimination and prejudice based on their identity.	"Well, that's just one isolated incident. It doesn't mean that white people can experience systemic racism like people of color do."
years down the road, people expressing negative thoughts about the president will be seen as a  national threat , giving the government legal means to seize them.	This statement is concerning as it suggests that expressing dissenting opinions will be criminalized, which goes against the principles of free speech and democracy.	"I don't think that will ever happen."
to which she replied that while the text never changes the rules do and that you just ignore the text.	I respectfully disagree. The text is the foundation of the rules and should always be followed, with any changes made through proper channels and not simply ignored.	"I don't think that's true, the text is always the same and the rules are set in stone."
now i realize that sales tax is technically a  pass through  tax, where the burden is shifted over to the consumer.	Actually, sales tax can also have an impact on businesses as they may have to increase their prices to cover the tax, which can ultimately affect their profits.	"I don't think that's true, I've never heard of a pass through tax before."
however, i am not really into the whole programming aspect, which i now realize the computer science major mostly consists of.	That's understandable, but it's important to keep in mind that computer science is a broad field with many different specializations, and there may be areas within it that interest you more than others.	"I don't think you fully understand what a computer science major entails."
identity theft would be less of a problem if the process of creating new credit card accounts was more secure.	"Improving the security of creating new credit card accounts may not completely eliminate identity theft, as fraudsters can still obtain personal information through other means such as phishing scams or data breaches."	"I don't think identity theft is a big deal and we don't need to worry about it."
as trans/queer gendered people are coming out and becoming more accepted, distinguishing between two genders for the bathroom just reinforces a gender binary that could potentially alienate them.	"Maintaining separate bathrooms for men and women is not intended to reinforce a gender binary, but rather to provide individuals with a safe and comfortable space to use the restroom."	"But having separate bathrooms for men and women is a longstanding tradition that should not be changed just to accommodate a small minority."
there are already unisex and family bathrooms some places that are used with no complaint.	"Just because there are some unisex and family bathrooms that are used without complaint, it doesn't mean that everyone feels comfortable using them or that they are available in all public places."	"But it's still important to maintain separate male and female bathrooms for privacy and safety reasons."
some students see the deadline of the coursework and decide to start doing the coursework on that day.	However, many students plan ahead and start working on their coursework well before the deadline to ensure they have enough time to complete it to the best of their ability.	"Well, everyone has their own way of working and some people work better under pressure."
or even the entirety of the us military vs blackwater blackwater never had a single failed mission in iraq .	While Blackwater may not have had a single failed mission in Iraq, their actions and tactics have been heavily criticized for causing harm to innocent civilians and exacerbating tensions in the region.	"But that doesn't mean Blackwater didn't have any controversies or ethical issues during their operations."
there is not a single example of a government organization working with greater efficiency than a corporate or private sector competitor.	This statement is not entirely accurate as there are many examples of government organizations, such as NASA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that have achieved significant success and efficiency in their respective fields.	"Well, I think government organizations can be just as efficient as corporate or private sector competitors."
if you do not exist as a living being, you cannot feel suffering.	Just because someone does not exist as a living being does not mean they cannot experience suffering in other forms, such as emotional or psychological pain.	"But what about the suffering of plants and other non-living things?"
the wrong or new definition of literally i am referring to is the opposite;  metaphorically, or figuratively.	Actually, the new definition of "literally" as an intensifier has been widely accepted and used for decades, even by reputable sources such as the Oxford English Dictionary. It's important to recognize that language evolves and changes over time.	"I don't think there is anything wrong with using 'literally' to mean figuratively, it's just a matter of language evolving."
i have always had a logical mind, and will always look for evidence of anything before believing it.	Just because you require evidence before believing something doesn't mean that evidence always exists or that beliefs can't be formed without it.	"Well, I don't really care about evidence. I just believe what I want to believe."
i just ca not see how intelligence and logical reasoning can coexist with religious beliefs.	Many intelligent and logical individuals have found a way to reconcile their religious beliefs with their rational thinking, and there are numerous examples of scientists and philosophers who have made significant contributions to their fields while maintaining a strong faith.	"Well, that's just your opinion."
i have always had a logical mind, and will always look for evidence of anything before believing it.	While a logical mind is certainly important, it's also important to consider that not all evidence is immediately apparent or easily accessible, and sometimes beliefs and experiences can also play a role in shaping one's perspective.	"Well, I don't think evidence is always necessary to believe something."
are these people delusional, unintelligent, or am i intolerant of other beliefs ?	It's important to respect and understand different beliefs, even if we don't agree with them. Let's focus on having open and respectful discussions instead of labeling others.	"You're just being close-minded and unable to accept different viewpoints."
second, an individual not eating meat makes zero difference, almost.	Actually, if more people choose to not eat meat, it can have a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving animal welfare.	"But if everyone stopped eating meat, it would make a huge difference."
as a vegetarian, you are not the consumer and therefore you are not of interest to them.	Being a vegetarian does not mean I am not a consumer. I still purchase products and services, and my dietary choices should be of interest to companies who want to cater to a diverse customer base.	"But I still buy vegetables and other products from them, so I am still a consumer."
i think elections are won one of two ways: based on geographic party affiliation i. e.	I disagree, I believe that elections can also be won based on the candidate's platform and their ability to connect with voters on issues that matter to them.	"I don't think party affiliation matters in elections."
neither of these reasons have dick to do with policy.	Actually, both of these reasons are directly related to policy and have significant impacts on its implementation.	"But policy is not the only factor that matters."
i think the electoral college system sucks balls.	While the electoral college system may have its flaws, it serves an important purpose in ensuring that all states have a say in the election process and preventing the domination of highly populated areas over less populated ones.	"You're wrong, the electoral college is a fair and necessary system."
in a similar manner all the people have to make some sort of effort to leave the comfort zone in order to know strangers.	While it's true that stepping out of one's comfort zone can lead to meeting new people, it's also important to prioritize safety and not put oneself in potentially dangerous situations.	"I don't think it's necessary to meet strangers, I'm happy with the people I already know."
what possible reason would there be for keeping a law or custom traditional if the said law or custom is in some way flawed generally either morally or due to limiting personal freedoms ?	Just because a law or custom may have flaws does not necessarily mean it should be completely abandoned. It is possible to address and improve upon these flaws while still maintaining the overall tradition or principle behind the law or custom.	"I don't see why we should change something that has been in place for so long just because some people don't like it."
i believe that drug use does not imply anything more negative about a person than playing video games does, cmv.	While both drug use and playing video games can have negative consequences, drug use carries a higher risk of addiction, health problems, and legal issues, making it a more significant concern than playing video games.	"Well, drug use is illegal and video games are not, so clearly there is a difference."
now i am used to having homework but sometimes i have extensive amounts of homework.	"Just remember that homework is essential for reinforcing what you learn in class and preparing you for future assignments and exams."	"I never have homework, so I can't relate to your struggle."
why insist on having your biological child when so many are in need of a family ?	While it's true that there are many children in need of a family, it's also important to respect an individual's desire to have a biological child and start a family of their own.	"Well, I just want to have a child that looks like me and shares my genes."
why add to the rapid deterioration of our environment by bringing another human being into existence ?	Bringing another human being into existence also means bringing new ideas, innovations, and solutions to the table to help improve and sustain our environment for future generations.	"Well, having children is a natural and fundamental part of human life and society."
the thing about morality, is you may never change anyone is mind.	While it may be difficult to change someone's mind about morality, it is not impossible and it is important to continue having open and respectful discussions in order to promote understanding and growth.	"That's not true, people can change their minds all the time."
similarly, if i were to walk up to a stranger and insult their outfit, that person would have every right to think i was an asshole.	However, it is important to remember that insulting someone's outfit or appearance is never acceptable behavior, regardless of the circumstances.	"Well, people are too sensitive these days. They should learn to take criticism."
if i were to walk up to a stranger and insult their outfit, that person would have every right to think i was an asshole.	It's always better to choose kindness and empathy over criticism and negativity, especially towards strangers.	"Well, I don't think it's that big of a deal. They should just brush it off."
when anything about suicide or disappearing from the world comes up, everyone looses their mind.	Actually, it's important to take discussions about suicide and disappearing seriously and provide support to those who may be struggling with these issues. It's not something to be taken lightly or dismissed as "losing one's mind."	"I don't see what the big deal is, people should just get over it."
when you consider the christian view of heaven being a place where  sin  does t exist then there is no free will, not really since you can only choose to do the  right  action.	This is not entirely accurate as free will does not necessarily require the ability to choose between right and wrong actions. Rather, it is the ability to make choices and act on them, even if those choices are limited by certain moral or ethical principles. In heaven, individuals may still have the freedom to make choices and act on them, but those choices may be guided by a deeper understanding and appreciation of what is truly good and virtuous.	"But people still have the choice to believe in God or not, so free will does exist."
scientific theories could be tweaked, and interpreted differently, which would not make you wrong, but does make your perception of the theory called into question.	While it is true that scientific theories can be interpreted differently, it is important to remember that the scientific method relies on empirical evidence and logical reasoning, so interpretations must be supported by evidence and logical arguments.	"I don't think that's true, scientific theories are always clear and straightforward."
the time and effort the psychiatric institution has put in the diagnosis is less than the time and effort i myself put in as far as i can tell.	It's important to remember that psychiatric professionals have years of education and experience in diagnosing mental health conditions, and their assessments should not be dismissed lightly.	"I don't think you understand the complexity of psychiatric diagnoses and the amount of training and expertise required to make accurate assessments."
every day users are more likely on average to lose motivation and become content with short term stimulus compared to achieving long term goals.	This statement may not be true for all users as some individuals may have a strong sense of self-discipline and motivation to achieve their long-term goals despite short-term distractions.	"I don't think that's true, I know plenty of people who stay motivated and focused on their long term goals."
not to mention the amount of people who die each year due to violence with the use of guns and firearms such as mass killings of innocent lives.	While it is true that gun violence is a serious issue, it is important to remember that the vast majority of gun owners are responsible and law-abiding citizens who use their firearms for self-defense, hunting, and sport shooting.	"Well, guns don't kill people, people kill people."
please, give me an example of something that provides for others which does not run on money.	Money may not be the only means of providing for others, as time, skills, and resources can also be valuable contributions.	"I can't think of anything that doesn't involve money, so I guess there are no examples."
i see  gifted  students as being kids with greater potential than the average student, either through greater intrinsic motivation or natural talent.	However, it is important to recognize that students with high potential may not always have the same level of motivation or natural talent, and that labeling them as "gifted" can create unnecessary pressure and expectations.	"Well, I think all students are equal and should be treated the same."
so, a society has more to gain by exploiting their potential than that of the average student.	This statement ignores the fact that every individual has their own unique potential and should be given equal opportunities to explore and develop it, regardless of their social status or background.	"Well, I don't think that's necessarily true. Average students can still contribute a lot to society."
secondly, there is danger in leaving any students unchallenged.	On the contrary, not all students need to be challenged in the same way and some may benefit from a more relaxed approach to learning.	"I don't think it's a big deal if some students aren't challenged."
if we are not promoting gifted education, then we are effectively encouraging mediocrity.	Not everyone has the same strengths and talents, and it's important to recognize and support all students, not just those who are considered gifted. Encouraging mediocrity implies that only exceptional students are worthy of attention and resources, which is not a fair or inclusive approach to education.	"That's not necessarily true, there are other ways to encourage excellence besides gifted education."
so, a society has more to gain by exploiting their potential than that of the average student.	This statement overlooks the fact that every individual has unique talents and abilities, and it is important to provide equal opportunities for all students to reach their full potential, not just those who are perceived as above average.	"Well, I don't think that's necessarily true."
there is danger in leaving any students unchallenged.	Not all students need to be constantly challenged; some may benefit from a more relaxed and supportive learning environment.	"Who cares if some students aren't challenged?"
societies that promote intellectualism ought to promote gifted programs.	Not all gifted students excel in academic settings, and promoting intellectualism may not necessarily benefit those who excel in other areas such as the arts or athletics.	"But not everyone is gifted, so it's unfair to only focus on them."
being offended by someone who had painted is face black is dumb as the original issues with are not relevant nowadays.	Your statement shows a lack of understanding of the historical context and ongoing effects of blackface, and it is not up to you to decide what is or isn't offensive to marginalized communities.	"Well, I don't see why people can't just lighten up and take a joke."
when people arent trying to take jobs that could have been filled in by black people and people arent trying to make a caricature out of black peolle then painting thaire face black shouldent be a problem.	This statement ignores the history and harmful connotations of blackface, and the fact that it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and reinforces systemic racism. It is never acceptable to use blackface, regardless of the context or intentions.	"But painting your face black is always offensive and should never be done."
a lot of people are butthurt about slavery, but slavery has no link to any of these traditions.	Slavery may not have a direct link to these traditions, but it has had a significant impact on the systemic oppression and marginalization of certain groups, which is why it is important to acknowledge and address its legacy.	"Well, some traditions are just outdated and need to be changed, like slavery."
if i do not use the internet that often, why should i pay more ?	"Because the cost of maintaining and improving internet infrastructure is shared among all users, regardless of usage frequency."	"Well, everyone else is paying the same amount, so why should you be an exception?"
in my opinion, greg is actions are completely within the bounds of  natural rights  and the motto that  your rights end where my nose begins .	I respectfully disagree as Greg's actions may infringe upon the natural rights of others and the motto of "your rights end where my nose begins" does not justify any harm caused to others.	"I disagree, I think Greg's actions are completely unjustified and he should be punished for violating others' rights."
a negative stereotype is that the british are known for their deceit and lies, from which their old oppressive empire was established.	This statement is not only offensive but also untrue. The British Empire was not solely built on deceit and lies, but rather through a complex history of political, economic, and social factors. It is unfair to generalize an entire group of people based on negative stereotypes.	"Well, not all British people are like that."
the exploitation of the working class, the environment, and the like, in the pursuit of profit, then, is an assault against all of humanity.	While it is true that some companies may prioritize profit over other concerns, it is important to recognize that many businesses also prioritize social and environmental responsibility.	"I don't think the pursuit of profit necessarily involves exploiting the working class or the environment."
so my question is:why are women allowed to have female centered mediums with biased views on men, but men are not ?	It is important to recognize that historically, men have held positions of power and privilege in society, and therefore their perspectives and experiences have been more widely represented and accepted. Women's perspectives and experiences have been marginalized and silenced, and female-centered media is a means of giving voice to those experiences and perspectives. It is not about bias against men, but rather about creating space for women to be heard and seen.	"Well, men have had centuries of male-centered media with biased views on women, so it's only fair that women have their turn."
any male based medium ca not seem to exist without the forced assimilation of women into it.	This statement is not entirely true as there are several male-based mediums that have successfully included and celebrated the contributions of women, such as the film industry with female directors, writers, and producers gaining recognition and awards.	"But women have their own mediums, so why do they need to infiltrate male-dominated ones?"
so my question is:why are women allowed to have female centered mediums with biased views on men, but men are not ?	It is important to recognize that men have historically held positions of power and privilege in society, and therefore, women creating female-centered mediums is a way to challenge and subvert this dominant narrative. Additionally, men are not restricted from creating their own male-centered mediums, but it is important to consider the impact and perpetuation of harmful stereotypes and biases in media.	"Well, men have had their fair share of biased media for centuries, so it's only fair that women get to have their own now."
serious negative effects of the  back to sleep  campaign has been the rise in incidence of flat headedness.	While it is true that the back to sleep campaign has led to an increase in flat headedness, it has also significantly reduced the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), which is a far more serious and life-threatening condition.	"But at least the back to sleep campaign has significantly reduced the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)."
even i have recieved some hate messages for disagreeing with them.	I'm sorry to hear that, but it's important to stand up for what you believe in and not let others' negativity bring you down.	"Well, maybe you just deserved those hate messages for not seeing their point of view."
with all the quinnspiracy and gamergate bullshit going on, i have come to the conclusion that gaming community of reddit is full of misogynistic neckbeards who are unable to take any critique.	That statement is unfair and overly generalized. While there may be a vocal minority within the gaming community who exhibit misogynistic behavior, it is not representative of the entire community. Many gamers are open to critique and strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all players.	"You're just overreacting, it's not that big of a deal."
gamergate is a movement that is apparently aiming to expose and combat the corruption in video games industry.	"However, the tactics employed by some members of Gamergate, such as doxxing and harassment of individuals, undermines any legitimate concerns they may have about corruption in the industry."	"I don't see how video game industry corruption is even a real issue worth addressing."
you can not prove what and who set anyone back and you ca not have serious discussions where the main premise of the discussion is  what if  and  what would happen .	On the contrary, having hypothetical discussions about potential scenarios can help us anticipate and prepare for different outcomes. It's important to consider all possibilities, even if we can't definitively prove what caused setbacks in the past.	"Well, I think it's important to consider all possibilities and hypothetical situations in a discussion."
by enlisting in the military, you have agreed to kill someone on behalf of the cause for which that military is fighting.	Not all military roles involve combat and killing, there are many non-combat positions that support the military's mission and objectives.	"But I joined the military to serve my country and protect its citizens, not specifically to kill someone."
the end result as with most polygamous societies in the past is a small number of elite men hoarding all the women.	Polygamous societies have been practiced in various forms across different cultures and time periods, and it is important to recognize that not all of them have resulted in the hoarding of women by a small group of men.	"Well, not all polygamous societies were like that."
i am forced to pay at least partially for all of these things and offered no way to choose where my money goes.	"You have the option to vote for representatives who align with your values and will prioritize funding for the programs and services you support."	"Well, you should just be grateful that you have the means to pay for these things in the first place."
apparently, i consented to these conditions by being born.	"Just because you were born into certain conditions does not mean you gave your consent to them."	"Well, you could have chosen not to be born."
if i refuse to pay taxes, i am fined.	Refusing to pay taxes is not only illegal but also unethical as it deprives the government of funds needed to provide essential services to the citizens.	"I don't care about the fine, I still won't pay taxes."
the quality of the debate you have with your friends at a dinner table is likely to be much, much poorer than a debate by experts.	While it's true that experts may have a deeper understanding of the topic at hand, the diversity of perspectives and personal experiences brought to the table by friends can often lead to a more nuanced and thought-provoking discussion.	"Well, I think my friends and I have pretty good debates at dinner parties."
ergo, its just a pr stunt common to today where people think change and effort is equaled to wearing a color sometimes.	I disagree, wearing a certain color can be a powerful symbol and a way to show solidarity and support for a cause, but it should not be the only action taken towards creating real change.	"I don't see why wearing a color can't be a form of showing support and raising awareness for a cause."
when i say incest, i mean consensual sex between two adults that are closely related.	Consent is not always possible in cases of incest due to power dynamics and familial pressure. Additionally, the genetic risks and potential harm to any resulting offspring cannot be ignored.	"But that's disgusting and wrong!"
when you become a parent, your brain chemistry changes and you biochemically become a completely different person.	While becoming a parent can certainly bring about changes in a person's brain chemistry, it does not necessarily mean that they become a completely different person.	"That's not true, becoming a parent doesn't change who you are as a person."
having a child is objectively a bad decision economically, time wise, etc.	While having a child may come with certain economic and time constraints, the emotional and personal fulfillment that comes with parenthood cannot be quantified or measured solely in terms of financial or time investments.	"But having a child brings emotional fulfillment and joy that cannot be measured by economic or time factors."
however, you miss out on what a significant part of the human experience.	But technology has also allowed us to connect with people and experiences that were previously inaccessible, expanding our understanding of the human experience.	"But I don't care about experiencing everything as long as I'm happy."
i am making the assumption that instead of child bearing the would be parent involves him or herself in some sort of meaningful charity work .	While charity work is certainly a noble pursuit, it should not be assumed that it is a substitute for the experience and responsibilities of parenthood.	"That's ridiculous, people should have children and focus on their own families instead of wasting time on charity work."
when you become a parent, your brain chemistry changes and you biochemically become a completely different person.	While becoming a parent can certainly alter brain chemistry, it does not necessarily result in a complete biochemical transformation of one's identity as a person.	"That's not true, becoming a parent doesn't change who you are as a person."
not having child is objectively a great decision, economically, time wise, etc.	While not having a child may make sense for some individuals, it is important to recognize that parenthood can bring immense joy and fulfillment that cannot be measured solely in economic or time-related terms.	"But having children brings so much joy and fulfillment to life."
only the most stupid perpetrators will be caught.	It is not fair to make sweeping judgments about the intelligence of perpetrators, as there are many factors that can contribute to their actions.	"All perpetrators are intelligent enough to evade capture."
but so can other behaviors by resentful lovers, such as gossip, cheating, backstabbing, betrayal, and financial exploitation.	While those behaviors may also be exhibited by resentful lovers, it does not excuse or justify the act of stalking, which can cause significant harm and trauma to the victim.	"I don't think that's true, I've never seen anyone behave like that when they're upset."
we should teach what is the most common.	"Teaching only what is most common may limit students' exposure to diverse perspectives and hinder their ability to think critically and creatively."	"But what if the most common is not necessarily the most important or relevant?"
the point of class is to teach how to avoid getting knocked up, avoid stds and learn what happens during puberty.	The point of class should also be to teach about healthy relationships, consent, and self-respect, not just avoidance of negative outcomes.	"That's not the only point of class, there are many other important topics that need to be covered."
we could spend more time teaching safe sex and avoiding teen pregnancies, which lead to drop outs.	Teaching safe sex and preventing teen pregnancies is important, but it's not the only factor that contributes to dropouts. Other factors such as poverty, lack of access to resources, and mental health issues also play a significant role.	"But teen pregnancies are a personal choice and should not be blamed for dropouts."
cultures are not entities that have or can have rights, nor are cultural differences inherently valuable or wrong, for that matter .	But cultural diversity should be celebrated and respected, and cultural rights are essential for the protection of minority groups and their traditions.	"But cultural diversity is what makes the world interesting and unique, so it must be valued and protected at all costs."
indeed, anybody who is  pro violence  i automatically dislike.	I understand your stance on violence, but it's important to consider the context and reasons behind someone's beliefs before automatically disliking them.	"Well, I don't think violence is always bad."
when financial wizards who contribute nothing of value for the nation are able to capture increasingly more of the nation is productivity for themselves at the expense of everyone else, that is parasitism.	Not all financial wizards are parasites; many of them create jobs and contribute to the economy through their investments and innovations.	"Well, financial wizards actually do contribute to the economy by creating jobs and investing in businesses."
the successful parasite is first best move is to jam the host organism is immune system, which in our case, would be a functioning government/democracy and progressive taxation.	This comparison between a successful parasite and a functioning government/democracy is flawed and inappropriate. A government serves the people and promotes the common good, whereas a parasite harms its host for its own benefit.	"I don't think parasites are a good analogy for discussing government and taxation."
what economists politely call rent seeking, the rest of us call parasitism.	While rent seeking may involve seeking out economic rents, it is not necessarily parasitic behavior as it can also drive innovation and competition in markets.	"I don't think it's fair to compare rent seeking to parasitism."
the successful parasite is first best move is to jam the host organism is immune system, which in our case, would be a functioning government/democracy and progressive taxation.	This statement oversimplifies the complex relationship between parasites and their hosts, and ignores the fact that successful parasites often coexist with their hosts without causing harm to their immune systems or overall health. Additionally, comparing a functioning government to a host organism undermines the positive role that government can play in promoting public health and welfare.	"I don't think parasites are a relevant topic to discuss in politics."
more people care about breast cancer because its viewed and primarily is a cancer that affects women.	"While breast cancer does primarily affect women, it is important to note that men can also develop the disease and it is crucial to raise awareness and support for all individuals affected by breast cancer."	"But men can also get breast cancer, so it's not just a women's issue."
i do not care about being right i care about losing weight, and i never wanna do yoga again !	"Actually, incorporating yoga into your weight loss journey can have numerous benefits for both your physical and mental health. Maybe you just haven't found the right type or instructor yet."	"Well, yoga is actually really good for weight loss, so maybe you should reconsider."
lessons of trust, betrayal the art of deception can be learned from shows such as big brother and survivor.	While reality shows may showcase certain behaviors, it's important to remember that they are often edited and manipulated for entertainment purposes, and may not accurately reflect real-life situations or relationships.	"I don't think reality TV shows are a good source of learning anything."
reality tv is also a great source of knowledge on different cultures and societies that a regular person might have not got the chance to stumble across.	While it's true that reality TV can showcase different cultures and societies, it often does so in a stereotypical or sensationalized manner that can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misrepresentations.	"Reality TV is just mindless entertainment, there's nothing to learn from it."
distributed networks are harder to do in every regard.	While it may be true that distributed networks can present some challenges, they also offer numerous benefits such as increased security and scalability.	"I disagree, I think distributed networks are easy to set up and maintain."
and often harder to use on for the user.	However, with proper training and user-friendly interfaces, the difficulty of use can be greatly reduced.	"I don't think that's true."
what will actually happen if racism in terms of discrimination on housing, employment, and public services is legalized, is that the free market will react to the demand of racist services.	Legalizing racism in any form is not only morally reprehensible but also goes against the fundamental principles of equality and justice. The free market should not be used as an excuse to perpetuate discriminatory practices that harm individuals and communities.	"That's not true, racism is not a marketable commodity and people will not support it."
markets will react by opening up segregated shops and restaurants.	Segregated businesses only perpetuate discrimination and do not promote equality in any way.	"I don't think markets will do that."
the country will become divided up into those that tolerate other races and those that do not.	This statement is overly simplistic and divisive, as individuals' attitudes towards race are complex and cannot be neatly categorized into binary groups.	"I don't see why race is even an issue, we should all just get along."
tell me why the society that condones racism is  better , especially for minorities.	There is no evidence to suggest that a society that condones racism is better for minorities. In fact, such a society perpetuates systemic discrimination and inequality, leading to harm and marginalization of minority groups.	"Well, racism isn't always bad. Sometimes it's just a matter of preference."
what will actually happen if racism in terms of discrimination on housing, employment, and public services is legalized, is that the free market will react to the demand of racist services.	Legalizing racism in any form is not only morally reprehensible but also goes against the fundamental principles of equality and justice that our society is built upon. Allowing discrimination in housing, employment, and public services will only perpetuate systemic inequality and hinder the progress towards a truly fair and just society.	"I don't think racism should be legalized, but I also don't think the free market should be blamed for it."
the country will become divided up into those that tolerate other races and those that do not.	This statement oversimplifies the complex issue of race relations and fails to acknowledge the many individuals and communities who actively work towards promoting diversity and inclusion.	"Well, I don't see why we should have to tolerate other races anyway."
what will actually happen if racism in terms of discrimination on housing, employment, and public services is legalized, is that the free market will react to the demand of racist services.	Legalizing racism in any form is unacceptable and goes against the principles of equality and justice that our society should uphold. It is not the free market's responsibility to cater to discriminatory demands, but rather the responsibility of individuals and institutions to actively work towards eradicating racism and promoting inclusivity.	"That's not true, racism is illegal and cannot be legalized."
where discrimination for the sole reason of sex/race/etc is completely ok.	Discrimination of any kind is never ok and goes against the principles of equality and fairness.	"I don't think discrimination is ever okay."
libertarians claim that the free market or  social pressure  will eventually lead to a post racial world.	However, history has shown that the free market and social pressure alone have not been sufficient in eliminating systemic racism and discrimination.	"But history has shown that the free market and social pressure have actually perpetuated racial inequalities."
what will actually happen if racism in terms of discrimination on housing, employment, and public services is legalized, is that the free market will react to the demand of racist services.	Legalizing racism in any form will not only be morally wrong but will also lead to a society where discrimination and inequality are accepted norms, which can have devastating consequences for marginalized communities.	"Well, I don't think racism should be legalized, but I don't think the free market would necessarily react in that way."
i tire of discussions of natural rights and how libertarians treat everyone with equality, because everyone is allowed to discriminate equally !	"That is a flawed argument as treating everyone equally does not mean allowing discrimination, and true libertarians believe in respecting individual rights and freedoms without infringing on the rights of others."	"But libertarians believe in individual freedom and personal responsibility, which is why they support equal opportunity for all."
tell me why the society that condones racism is  better , especially for minorities.	There is no evidence to suggest that a society that condones racism is better for minorities, as racism perpetuates systemic inequalities and discrimination.	"Well, some people just prefer to stick with their own kind."
the country will become divided up into those that tolerate other races and those that do not.	Dividing the country based on race is not a solution, we should focus on promoting diversity and inclusion for all.	"Well, I don't see why race should even be an issue in the first place."
racism stems from negative stereotypes that are trumped up and oppress a people in a certain group.	While negative stereotypes can contribute to racism, it is important to recognize that racism also stems from systemic power imbalances and historical injustices that have marginalized certain groups.	"But some stereotypes are based on truth, and not all people in a certain group are oppressed."
canadian soldiers recently killed are receiving an undue amount of compassion and attention.	As human beings, it is important to show empathy and respect towards those who have lost their lives while serving their country, regardless of their nationality.	"Well, they signed up for the job knowing the risks, so they shouldn't expect sympathy."
questionable coverage at other than peak commute times.	"While it is true that coverage may not be at its peak during non-commute times, it is important to note that the availability of transportation options is still vital for individuals who work non-traditional hours or have other commitments outside of peak times."	"I don't think that's true."
i seriously believe that men and women probably make a very similar number; a number so similar that there are no grounds for advocating either gender needs more pay.	However, studies have shown that on average, women earn less than men for the same job and experience, indicating that there are indeed grounds for advocating for equal pay regardless of gender.	"Well, I think men are clearly more qualified and capable than women, so they deserve higher pay."
i have seen a million studies that show women make less.	"Actually, many studies have shown that the gender pay gap is more complex than a simple comparison of men and women's salaries, and factors such as education level, job type, and years of experience also play a significant role."	"Well, I don't believe it because I've never seen those studies."
on average, women are less capable at defending against a physical attack than their male counterparts.	This statement is a harmful stereotype that is not supported by evidence. Women can be just as capable of defending themselves as men, and it is important to focus on empowering all individuals with self-defense skills regardless of gender.	"That's not true, I know plenty of women who could easily defend themselves."
i am pointing out that there are specific firearms that have no impact on violence at large, yet are the first ones targeted.	But every firearm has the potential to be used in a violent manner, and we need to take steps to limit access to all dangerous weapons.	"But all firearms contribute to the culture of violence and should be banned."
the view to challenge is the one of happiness being dependant on maintaining ignorance.	Happiness is not solely dependent on ignorance, but rather on a combination of knowledge, perspective, and personal values.	"I don't think ignorance has anything to do with happiness."
if you have not gone to medical school and graduated with a m. d.	That may be true, but I have extensive experience and knowledge in the medical field through years of working as a nurse/medical assistant/researcher/etc.	"Well, I know someone who didn't go to medical school and they're a great doctor!"
the problem lies not within people  being born in the wrong skin , but within society is narrow definitions of men and women and of masculinity and femininity.	While societal definitions of gender do play a role, it is important to acknowledge the very real struggles and discrimination faced by individuals who are born in the wrong body and the importance of supporting their journey towards self-acceptance and gender identity.	"That's not true, people should just accept their biological gender and not try to change it."
through traditional stereotypes of masculinity and femininity, gender creates a categorization of behaviors, qualities, and images as belonging either to men or women.	While it is true that traditional stereotypes have contributed to the categorization of certain behaviors and qualities as masculine or feminine, it is important to recognize that gender is a complex and multifaceted concept that cannot be reduced to simplistic binaries.	"Gender doesn't really have any impact on behavior or qualities, it's just a social construct."
however, by my understand of the definitions, a person must fall into one of the two categories either in their professed beliefs or by their behavior.	I respectfully disagree with your interpretation of the definitions and believe that a person's beliefs and behavior are not mutually exclusive and can be fluid and dynamic.	"Well, I don't think that's necessarily true."
why am i lucky that a deadline was extended because of a situation out of my control ?	"Well, it's not about luck, it's about being responsible and proactive in communicating any issues that may affect meeting a deadline. It's always better to ask for an extension than to miss a deadline."	"I don't think it's lucky, it's just a normal occurrence."
the atrocities that the german army commited are similar to those commited by other armies in other wars.	While it is true that atrocities have been committed by various armies throughout history, it is important to hold each responsible for their own actions and not diminish the severity of the German army's crimes during World War II.	"But the German army's atrocities were much worse than any other army's."
tattoos are not just for gang members and social outcasts.	"Tattoos are a form of self-expression and have been embraced by people from all walks of life, including professionals and celebrities."	"But tattoos still have a negative connotation and can hurt your chances of getting a job."
i am still confused as to why an employer would care ?	"Employers care about their employees' understanding of their job responsibilities and company values to ensure a productive and positive work environment."	"Well, obviously an employer would care because they want to make money."
would i even want to work for a company that is so narrow minded about what makes a good employee ?	"Perhaps the company has a specific vision and values that they prioritize in their employees, which can lead to a more cohesive and successful team dynamic."	"I don't see why it matters, as long as they pay well."
dmt the method  ayahuasca  which involved mixing two specific plant extracts together to allow the proper absorption of dmt similar to lsd but naturally occurring in a number of living things .	While ayahuasca may contain DMT, it is important to note that the effects and experiences of ayahuasca are vastly different from those of LSD due to the different chemical structures and mechanisms of action.	"I don't believe in natural remedies, so I don't think ayahuasca is a valid form of medicine."
if i gave to everyone who deserved it, i would go broke.	"But isn't it better to give to those who deserve it rather than wasting resources on those who don't?"	"But it's important to be generous and help others in need."
i do not think the argument that he was revolutionary for his time a good one either.	On the contrary, his ideas and actions were groundbreaking and paved the way for significant social change.	"Well, I disagree with your opinion."
if you believe in a higher power or god, you get rewarded if you are right.	Believing in a higher power or god solely for the sake of potential rewards undermines the sincerity and authenticity of one's faith.	"Well, what about atheists? They don't believe in a higher power and they can still lead successful and fulfilling lives."
betting on there being a god is the smart decision because there might be a pay off, while atheism has no reward.	Believing in a god solely for the potential reward goes against the principles of genuine faith and undermines the importance of personal conviction.	"But what if the pay off is not worth the cost of believing in something without evidence?"
one of my frustrations when trying to discuss feminism or equality is that as a man i feel my ideas or opinions are largely ignored or attacked by women.	"It's important to remember that feminism and equality are not just women's issues, but issues that affect everyone. Your ideas and opinions as a man are valuable and should be heard, but it's also important to listen to and learn from the experiences and perspectives of women."	"Well, that's just because women are too emotional and don't know how to have a rational discussion."
anyways in trying to understand why these discussions so often breakdown i came to the conclusion that what one person considers equal another does not.	I disagree with your conclusion as I believe that breakdowns in discussions often occur due to a lack of active listening and an unwillingness to consider differing perspectives.	"Well, I don't think that's always the case. Sometimes people just have different communication styles."
one of my frustrations when trying to discuss feminism or equality is that as a man i feel my ideas or opinions are largely ignored or attacked by women.	It's important to remember that while men may face some challenges when discussing feminism, women have historically been silenced and dismissed in these conversations, and it's crucial to listen to and prioritize their voices.	"Well, that's just because men have been the oppressors for so long, so it's natural for women to be skeptical of your ideas."
, if a man is held responsible for his actions while intoxicated should not a woman be as well.	The effects of intoxication can vary greatly between individuals and it is important to consider the circumstances and level of impairment before assigning responsibility.	"But women are more emotional and less able to control themselves when drunk."
anyways in trying to understand why these discussions so often breakdown i came to the conclusion that what one person considers equal another does not.	I disagree with your conclusion as I believe that breakdowns in discussions can also occur due to misunderstandings or lack of effective communication.	"Well, I don't think that's always the case. Sometimes people just don't listen to each other."
reddit often is not mature enough to deal with those kinds of posts.	I disagree, as I have seen many instances where the Reddit community handles sensitive and controversial topics with maturity and empathy.	"Well, I think Reddit is always mature enough to handle any kind of post."
, if a man is held responsible for his actions while intoxicated should not a woman be as well.	It is important to consider the potential differences in how alcohol affects men and women, and how societal expectations and gender roles may also play a role in determining responsibility for actions while intoxicated.	"But women are more emotional and less capable of controlling their actions while intoxicated."
these kinds of posts are easy to fake for attention.	Just because some posts may be fake doesn't mean that all posts are fake. Many people share their genuine experiences and opinions on social media.	"I don't think that's true, people wouldn't waste their time faking posts for attention."
reddit often is not mature enough to deal with those kinds of posts.	I disagree, as I have seen many instances where the Reddit community has handled sensitive or controversial posts with maturity and understanding.	"That's not true, Reddit users are very mature and can handle any kind of post."
in almost all jurisdictions, laws regarding sexuality place consent as the most important factor.	"While consent is certainly a crucial aspect of sexual interactions, there are also other important factors such as power dynamics, coercion, and exploitation that must be taken into account in shaping laws regarding sexuality."	"Well, I don't think consent is that important. People should just do what they want."
these kinds of posts are easy to fake for attention.	Just because some posts can be faked doesn't mean that all posts are fake. It's important to evaluate each post on its own merits and not make assumptions based on a few bad examples.	"I don't think that's true, people usually post things because they want to share their experiences."
in almost all jurisdictions, laws regarding sexuality place consent as the most important factor.	While consent is certainly an important factor in laws regarding sexuality, there are also other factors such as age and mental capacity that are taken into consideration in some jurisdictions.	"Well, I don't think consent is that important in some cultures and religions."
an animal cannot consent to a sexual act being performed on it, as animals cannot speak or otherwise show desire for humans.	"Just because animals cannot communicate in the same way as humans does not mean they are incapable of expressing discomfort or distress during a sexual act, and it is our responsibility to respect their bodily autonomy and prevent any harm or exploitation."	"But animals also cannot say no to sexual acts, so why not just assume they're okay with it?"
an animal cannot consent to a sexual act being performed on it, as animals cannot speak or otherwise show desire for humans.	While it is true that animals cannot verbally consent to sexual acts, they can still display behaviors and body language that indicate their willingness or lack thereof. Additionally, the absence of a clear "no" does not equate to consent, especially when considering power dynamics between humans and animals.	"But animals can still show physical signs of arousal, indicating their willingness to engage in sexual acts with humans."
if there are either no guns or very limited types of guns in the us there can be no effective defense against a tyrannical government.	This statement assumes that the only way to defend against a tyrannical government is through the use of guns, but history has shown that nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience have also been effective means of challenging oppressive regimes.	"But having too many guns also leads to more gun violence and mass shootings."
the government passes a law that is clearly  wrong .	It's important to remember that laws are often complex and require careful consideration before passing judgment on their effectiveness or morality.	"Well, the government knows what's best for the country, so the law must be right."
if there are either no guns or very limited types of guns in the us there can be no effective defense against a tyrannical government.	This statement assumes that the only way to defend against a tyrannical government is through the use of guns, ignoring the potential effectiveness of nonviolent resistance and other forms of civil disobedience.	"But other countries with strict gun laws have not experienced a tyrannical government, so it's not necessary to have guns for defense."
the government passes a law that is clearly  wrong .	That statement is subjective and open to interpretation. It would be more accurate to say that some people may disagree with the law passed by the government.	"Well, the government must have had a good reason for passing the law."
if there are either no guns or very limited types of guns in the us there can be no effective defense against a tyrannical government.	The idea that citizens need access to a wide variety of guns in order to defend against a tyrannical government is a flawed argument, as history has shown that successful uprisings against oppressive regimes have often relied on tactics such as guerrilla warfare and nonviolent resistance.	"But other countries with strict gun laws have not experienced tyranny."
you now would have to do all that shit on your own.	Actually, I have been doing it on my own and I'm quite capable of handling it.	"I don't care, I can handle it."
if there are either no guns or very limited types of guns in the us there can be no effective defense against a tyrannical government.	This argument assumes that the only way to defend against a tyrannical government is through the use of guns, but history shows that nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience have also been effective means of overthrowing oppressive regimes.	"But countries like Japan have strict gun laws and they still have a low crime rate."
or users would just stop using social networking as much.	However, social networking has become an integral part of modern communication and it is unlikely that users would completely stop using it.	"Well, social networking is addicting, so users will never stop using it."
you now would have to do all that shit on your own.	I don't mind doing it on my own, it will be a great learning experience.	"I don't think it's that big of a deal."

However, the increasing number of social media users and their reliance on it for communication and information suggests that it is unlikely for users to completely stop using social networking.	"But social networking is too addictive for people to just stop using it."
that would take hours to burn off, even with incredibly strenuous exercise and might lead you to give up on your diet for that day.	"But indulging in a small treat every now and then can actually help you stick to your diet in the long run by preventing feelings of deprivation and promoting a balanced approach to eating."	"I don't think it's a big deal, I'll just skip dinner tonight."

"Well, I don't mind skipping a day of my diet once in a while."
singing is simply a muscular contraction, you train your vocal chords to output a certain pitch and timbre.	While singing does involve muscular contractions, it is also a complex process that involves breath control, resonance, and expression. Training vocal chords is just one aspect of developing a strong and expressive singing voice.	"I don't think that's true, singing is more about having a natural talent and being born with a good voice."

buying the same kind of wallet again and again only implies insanity and not greed.	I disagree, buying the same kind of wallet again and again may simply imply that the person has found a product they trust and prefer to use consistently.	"Well, I don't think it's insane to want to have multiple wallets in case one gets lost or damaged."
buying the same kind of wallet again and again only implies insanity and not greed.	I disagree, buying the same kind of wallet can simply mean that the person has found a style and brand that they trust and prefer over others.	"Well, I don't think it's that crazy to want to have multiple wallets in the same style."
thus, the us remains the best counter to tyranny in the world.	While the US may have historically played a role in countering tyranny, it is important to recognize that there are other countries and international organizations that also play a significant role in promoting democracy and human rights around the world.	"That's not true, other countries can also stand up against tyranny."
thus, the us remains the best counter to tyranny in the world.	While the US may have historically opposed tyranny, its recent actions suggest otherwise, such as its support for authoritarian regimes and disregard for human rights violations.	"But other countries also have strong democratic systems and can stand up against tyranny."
from hygiene improvements, to increasing indoor plumbing, to funding research programs into vaccines and future medicines.	While those initiatives are important, we should also focus on addressing the root causes of health disparities, such as poverty, inadequate access to healthcare, and systemic racism.	"I don't think any of those things are necessary."
from hygiene improvements, to increasing indoor plumbing, to funding research programs into vaccines and future medicines.	However, it's important to prioritize funding for basic healthcare needs such as access to clean water and sanitation facilities before investing in research programs.	"I don't think any of those things are really necessary."
why not just use a word for all.	Using a single word for everything would oversimplify and limit our ability to express complex ideas and emotions.	"I don't see the point in that."
the idea that you should spend half or more of a yearly income on a wedding ring is the most disgusting financial advice i have ever heard.	Actually, spending a significant amount on a wedding ring is a symbol of commitment and love, and can hold sentimental value for a lifetime.	"Well, some people just value the symbolism of a wedding ring more than others."
why not just use a word for all.	Using a single word for everything would limit our ability to express nuance and complexity in language.	"I don't see the point in using one word when we have so many options to choose from."
the idea that you should spend half or more of a yearly income on a wedding ring is the most disgusting financial advice i have ever heard.	Well, everyone has their own priorities and values when it comes to spending money, and for some people, a wedding ring is a symbol of love and commitment that they are willing to invest in. It's not necessarily disgusting financial advice, but rather a personal decision.	"Well, some people believe that a wedding ring is a symbol of love and commitment, so it's worth spending a lot of money on."
if you are making median wage, you should be aiming for a nice several hundred dollar ring.	This statement is not universally applicable as people have different financial priorities and values. Some may prefer to save their money for other important expenses or investments rather than spending it on a ring.	"But what if the person doesn't value material possessions and would rather save their money for something else?"
